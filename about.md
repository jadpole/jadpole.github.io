I am a self-taught software developer working at Stingray, where I lead the Data
team.  My day-to-day work revolves around _data_ -- its lineage, infrastructure,
governance and automation.

I am a proponent of strong type-systems, functional programming when possible,
and imperative programming with tracked side-effects otherwise.
