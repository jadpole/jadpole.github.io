Today's article will focus on creating a few `struct`s for handling events,
abstracting away rust-sdl's `EventPump`. We are going to learn more about
pattern matching and `use` statements in a module and in a function. I will also
touch on a deprecated version of this code, written when rust-sdl2 was still in
version 0.6, in order to illustrate how you would use lifetimes in a type
declaration.

So, let's get to it!


## Submodules

Before we make our first step toward handling events, I would like to add a new
_module_ to our project. A module is just a way to keep our code structured. We
could, in theory, write everything in a single file and in a single namespace,
but it would get pretty messy, pretty quickly. A compiler doesn't care, but a
human does. So, we're going to put our event-related code in a separate file.

To do that, we have to add the `events.rs` file to our `src/` folder.

    $ <editor> src/events.rs

This will be our `events` module. Inside this file, we will declare a structure
(a custom type) which wraps the `EventPump` provided by SDL. Because we are
strategically lazy human beings, we will `use` this type.

```rust
extern crate sdl2;
use self::sdl2::EventPump;
```

One thing you might notice is the `self` keyword appearing in the path to the
`EventPump`. This means: _this path is relative to the current module_. This
works because, by adding `extern crate sdl2` at the top of our file, we _added_
the content of the `sdl2` crate to our module. It then acts as a _private_
sub-module of `events`.

Alternatively, because we added `extern crate sdl2` to our main file &mdash; and
it would work the same way if this line was present in the `lib.rs` file of a
library &mdash;, we could do it this way:

```rust
use ::sdl2::EventPump;
```

Notice that we did not include an `extern crate` statement in here. This is
called the _absolute path_ (where the _root_ of your path is the main file of
your crate). The way you do it depends on your preference. This is also why we
can use an absolute path when _using_ a structure in the standard library, from
anywhere in the program: an `extern crate std` statement is automatically added
by the _prelude_, at the begin of the `main.rs` or `lib.rs` file.

If you compile this code right now, you will probably not see any difference.
This is because we have not yet told Rust that `events` is a module, and more
precisely that it is a module _whose parent is :: (main.rs)_. We do that by
adding the following line somewhere at the top of the `src/main.rs` file:

```rust
mod events;
```

Once that's done, Rust will first look to see whether there is a file called
`events.rs` in the same directory as its parent. If there is none, then it will
search the directory for another folder called `events/`, which contains a file
named `mod.rs`. If there is, then the content of `mod.rs` is chosen to be that
of the module. For now, though, we will stick to a flat structure.

You should note that, unless you start the path with `self`, the `use` statement
will automatically insert `::` for you at the beginning of the path. Therefore,
we could (and will) include the event pump with:

```rust
use sdl2::EventPump;
```

However, this is _not_ how Rust works in any other case, though. For example, if
we were in `some/submodule.rs`, then we could not write:

```rust
some::other::submodule();
```

We would have to explicitly specify that the path starts from the root of the
project.

```rust
::some::other::submodule();
```

This makes sense: 90% of the time, when defining types and functions, you would
like to access items declared in the same file. When _importing_ stuff, however,
we typically want to access the interface defined in a library or another file
of our project &mdash; otherwise, we wouldn't need to import it in the first
place.


## Historical tangent and lifetimes crash course

Now, back to our `events.rs` file! The first step in handling events is all
about wrapping the `EventPump` provided by the SDL context. So, we will add the
following code to our new module:

```rust
//? Note: the <'p> annotation is no longer necessary.
pub struct Events<'p> {
    pump: EventPump<'p>
}
```

But what are these `<'p>` all over the place?

I like to think of the list inside `<>` as being a _type configuration_. In
languages like C++, _generics_ allow you to assign a _type_ to a collection,
one which specifies the type of the objects that inhabit it. In Rust, not
only does the type-system know about _types_, it also knows about these things
called _lifetimes_. Lifetimes are a way to express _A should not outlive B_
and, while type parameters begin with a capital letter, like `T`, lifetime
parameters begin with a lowercase letter and are prefixed by an apostrophe,
like `'p`.

Lifetimes are the thing that everybody refers to when they say that, in Rust,
_you cannot have dangling pointers_. You cannot have them because it would mean
that you tried to get the value that the reference _points to_ after it had
been destroyed, which would mean that your reference outlived the _thing_ it
points to... Yet Rust's type-system ensures, through lifetimes, that it cannot
happen, so if you were to make a mistake of the sort, you would get an error at
_compile time_, instead of having to chase down the bug at _run time_.

Lifetimes in Rust are as omnipresent as are types. In fact, even the
_hello world_ program uses them behind the scenes, although in the same way
that Rust allows you to omit types, most of the _lifetime business_ is
automatically inferred by the compiler!

And, like with type parameters, there are a few places where Rust asks you to be
explicit about what you are doing. I'm talking about function and type
declarations (although, when declaring functions, you can rely most of the time
on automatic _lifetime elision_, the lifetime equivalent to type inference).

The way you get an `EventPump` is by calling `sdl_context.event_pump()`. We
could imagine the type signature of the method being:

```rust
fn event_pump<'p>(&'p mut self) -> EventPump<'p>;
```

The types in this signature inform us that the `event_pump` method takes a
mutable reference to `sdl_context` (`self`) and returns an `EventPump`. What
the lifetimes tell us, however, is way more interesting. In functions, if an
argument and a returned value have the same lifetime, then it means that
_the returned value must not outlive the argument it depends on_. By simply
looking at the function signature, we know that the event pump must not live
longer than the context.

It would not make much sense otherwise, because then we would wait for events
that would never come. In a very deep sense, lifetimes are not only a way to
talk to the compiler about our data, but even more they're a way to talk to
other programmers (and future you) about what the invariants on the data are.
This is _much better_ than simply adding it to the documentation (which would
be the case in a C or Python library), because
[while developers can get distracted](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Using_freed_memory#Consequences),
a computer will
[always catch their errors](http://blog.skylight.io/rust-means-never-having-to-close-a-socket)
if it is programmed to.

When you'll start making things on your own, you will quickly realise that Rust
doesn't tolerate even the slightest ambiguity. It is very frustrating at first,
but once your code actually compiles and you've written a few tests for it, you
can be confident that it will _just work_, and this is really important.

You will spend more time trying to tell the compiler what you mean, and less
chasing down silly bugs such as dangling pointers and data races.

## Pumping the events

Nowadays, you can simply omit the lifetime. The folks working on rust-sdl2
decided that, instead, `EventPump` should simply stop spitting out events once
the context is dropped. Our code then translates to:

```rust
use sdl2::EventPump;

pub struct Events {
    pump: EventPump,
}
```

What we have done so far is declaring a public struct called `Events` (public
because it can be accessed from anywhere else in our codebase). We did not add
a `pub` keyword in front of the `pump` field, however, because we do not want
other parts of the program messing with it when we try to record the events,
which would make us miss some of them.

We now add an associated function called `new` to it, using an `impl` block:

```rust
impl Events {
    pub fn new(pump: EventPump) -> Events {
        Events {
            pump: pump,

            quit: false,
            key_escape: false,
        }
    }
}
```

It takes in an event pump and returns an instance of our struct. If you come
from a procedural language, you should notice that we did not need to use the
`return` keyword. The value of the function is set to that of its last
non-semicolon-terminated expression.

Now, we can bind an `events` value inside our `main` function. We also have to
make `sdl_context` mutable so that the `EventPump` can poll events from it
behind the scene. Then, your `src/main.rs` file should look something like:

```rust
extern crate sdl2;

mod events;

use events::Events;
use sdl2::pixels::Color;
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;


fn main() {
    // Initialize SDL2
    let mut sdl_context = sdl2::init().unwrap();
    let video = sdl_context.video().unwrap();

    // Create the window
    let window = video.window("ArcadeRS Shooter", 800, 600)
        .position_centered().opengl()
        .build().unwrap();

    let mut renderer = window.renderer()
        .accelerated()
        .build().unwrap();

    // Prepare the events record
    let mut events = Events::new(sdl_context.event_pump().unwrap());


    renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(0, 0, 0));
    renderer.clear();
    renderer.present();

    thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(3000));
}
```

Let us now do two things. First, we add a few public attributes to our `Events`
struct; then, we populate our object by pumping the events.

```rust
use sdl2::EventPump;

pub struct Events {
    pump: EventPump,

    pub quit: bool,
    pub key_escape: bool,
}

impl Events {
    pub fn new(pump: EventPump) -> Events {
        Events {
            pump: pump,

            quit: false,
            key_escape: false,
        }
    }

    /// Update the events record.
    pub fn pump(&mut self) {
        // If the SDL context is dropped, then poll_iter() will simply stop
        // yielding any input.
        for event in self.pump.poll_iter() {
            use sdl2::event::Event::*;
            use sdl2::keyboard::Keycode::*;

            match event {
                Quit { .. } => self.quit = true,

                KeyDown { keycode, .. } => match keycode {
                    Some(Escape) => self.key_escape = true,
                    _ => {}
                },

                KeyUp { keycode, .. } => match keycode {
                    Some(Escape) => self.key_escape = false,
                    _ => {}
                },

                _ => {}
            }
        }
    }
}
```

I'm guessing that you can figure out what most of this does on you own, however
I would like to focus on the `pump` method.

It takes as its only argument a mutable reference to `self` in order to pump the
events and modify the state of `quit` and `key_escape`. When called, it gets
an _iterator_ to the events from `pump` and iterates over every one of them
using a `for` loop.

At the very beginning of the `for` loop, we can see what I call
_scoped use statements_. Those act like any `use` statement, except that they
are only effective inside their block. It allows us to write `Quit` and `KeyUp`
without polluting the module's namespace with identifiers that we will not need
anywhere else anyway.

Then, we see our old acquaintance the `match` statement, which allows
_pattern matching and destructuring_. It is time to learn more about it.
If those confuse you, I would recommend you to read the following chapters
in the Rust book:

  * [Enums](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/enums.html)
  * [Match](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/match.html)
  * [Patterns](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/patterns.html)

So, as you might have guessed from staring at the above code excerpt, `event`
is an object of type `Event`, which is an enumeration. Then, on the following
line...

```rust
Quit { .. } => self.quit = true,
```

... we match for an event of type Quit. We do not care about the values of its
attributes, and so we simply ignore them using `..`: as long as our user has
asked to close the window, we set `self.quit` to `true`. Then, two lines later,
we have:

```rust
KeyDown { keycode, .. } => match keycode {
    Some(Escape) => self.key_escape = true,
    _ => {}
},
```

The first line says: if the user presses a key (pattern), then take the value
of its `keycode` field and assign it to the same name (destructuring). This
value has type `Option<::sdl2::keyboard::Keycode>` and is now available on
the right side of the `=>` under the name `keycode`, so we can match over the
destructured value.

We could give another name to the destructured `keycode` field, for example
`code`:

```rust
KeyDown { keycode: code, .. } => match code {
    Some(Escape) => self.key_escape = true,
    _ => {}
},
```

However, in this case, it only complicates things, so we won't do that.

If you take out the `..` at the end of the first pattern, then the Rust compiler
is going to complain that you have forgotten some values. This is a way for Rust
to ensure that we do not accidentally omit to check a value. The double dot
basically means: I know what I'm doing, ignore everything else. In the first
snippet, _everything else_ meant every field, without exception.

You should be able to determine the meaning of the next few lines by yourself.
If you are not, then take a look at the corresponding sections of
[Rust by Example](http://rustbyexample.com).


## Closing the window like a sane programmer

Let us now modify a bit our `src/main.rs` file:

```rust
extern crate sdl2;
mod events;

use sdl2::pixels::Color;
use events::Events;

fn main() {
    // Initialize SDL2
    let sdl_context = sdl2::init().unwrap();
    let video = sdl_context.video().unwrap();

    // Create the window
    let window = video.window("ArcadeRS Shooter", 800, 600)
        .position_centered().opengl()
        .build().unwrap();

    let mut renderer = window.renderer()
        .accelerated()
        .build().unwrap();

    let mut events = Events::new(sdl_context.event_pump().unwrap());

    loop {
        events.pump();

        if events.quit || events.key_escape {
            break;
        }

        renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(0, 0, 0));
        renderer.clear();
        renderer.present();
    }
}
```

As you can see, there is no more `thread::sleep` and `std::time::Duration` and
you can even remove the corresponding `use` statements (in fact, the linter
integrated inside `rustc` will warn you about it if you don't).

What we have here is an _infinite_ `loop`. In the second line, the `pump`
method borrows mutably `events`. Once it's done, it lends it back to the
`events` binding. The program then checks whether the user has tried to close
the window or pressed the escape key. If it is the case, then it _breaks_ out
of the main loop. Otherwise, it clears the screen with black, swaps the
buffers, and checks again.

We now have a sane window!

That's all I got for today. In the [next article](/arcaders/arcaders-1-3),
we will use macro wizardry to get events from a few other keys. We will use
these later when we build our menu and control our player's ship.

Until then, keep rusting!


## BONUS: Lifetime dependencies

When adding type parameters to a function's signature, we may write something
like:

```rust
fn sum_vec<T: Add<T, Output = T>>(args: Vec<T>) -> T;
```

You do not need to understand everything. Just notice the colon after the
declaration of the type `T` between the `<>`. This colon means: _depends on_.
In this case, `T` must implement the trait `Add<T, Output = T>`. That is, one
must be able to add two objects of type `T` and get a result of type `T`.

I wrote an [article](/rust/type-system) about how this _dependency_ relates to
set theory, in case you're interested.

It turns out that, with lifetimes, we can do something similar:

```rust
fn do_things<'a, 'b: 'a>(x: &'a Thing, y: &'b OtherThing);
```

Here, we have _`'b` depends on `'a`_. In Rust, this means that anything with
lifetime `'b` must not outlive anything else with lifetime `'a`. In fact, it
is even possible for type parameters to depend on lifetimes, but this is a
story for another time...

Set-theory-wise, you could think of it as intervals on the time-line of the
program, with some intervals being subsets of others. Here, \\(b \subset a\\).
