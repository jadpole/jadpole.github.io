This is the third part of a series whose objective is to explore the Rust
programming language through the development of a simple, old-school shooter.
It is composed of 16 parts, excluding the [introduction](/2015/185/arcaders-1-0):

  1. [A simple window](/2015/185/arcaders-1-1), where we install SDL2
  2. [Event handling](/2015/187/arcaders-1-2), where we discuss lifetimes
  3. [More event handling](/2015/187/arcaders-1-3), where we discuss macros
  4. [Views](/2015/188/arcaders-1-4), where we learn about boxes, pattern matching, trait objects, and dynamic dispatch
  5. [Switching views](#), where we use boxes, pattern matching, trait objects, and dynamic dispatch
  6. [A moving rectangle](#), where we draw _things_
  7. [Main menu](#), where we play with textures and Rust's vectors
  8. [Sprites](#), where we create shareable images
  9. [Backgrounds](#), where we handle resizing, scale and translate through time
  10. [The player's ship](#), where we control a multi-sprite object
  11. [Shooting bullets](#), where we handle resource pooling
  12. [Animated sprites](#), where we render animated asteroids
  13. [Asteroid attack!](#), where we make multiple objects interact
  14. [Explosions](#), where we see things do _boom_.
  15. [Music](#), where we hear things go _boom_.
  16. [High score & wrap-up](#), where we play with the filesystem


In this article, we will learn about macros, more macros, and how to use the
`Option<bool>` type to represent immediate events.

Before getting through this one, though, you should read the following chapter
from the Rust book:

  * [Macros](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/macros.html)

You don't need to _get_ everything, we're going to go at lengths anyway about
macros. What you do need to understand is the syntax for declaring macros, at
least at a high level.

Done? Cool, let's push forward!

Our objective in this article will be to take our simple `Events` structure and
make a gigantic macro out of it. This macro will allow us to choose which
events we care about at compile-time and generate the `Events` type from a few
arguments, which may change from one project to the next.

This may seem a bit overkill and, for such a short-lived project, it probably
is. However, this series is more about fun, experimentation, and seeing how the
pieces fit together, and less about the game itself. In that spirit, this is a
design choice that makes sense.

And, let's be frank, it's mostly because macros are __awesome__.


## Macros

You can now practically empty your `events.rs` file. We will start with the
_strict minimum_ and grow from there. What we will _add_, however, is a new,
empty struct called `ImmediateEvents`, which we will reset on every frame.
The code looks something like that:

```rust
use ::sdl2::event::EventPump;


pub struct ImmediateEvents;

impl ImmediateEvents {
    pub fn new() -> ImmediateEvents {
        ImmediateEvents
    }
}


pub struct Events<'p> {
    pump: EventPump<'p>,
    pub now: ImmediateEvents,
}

impl<'p> Events<'p> {
    pub fn new(pump: EventPump<'p>) -> Events<'p> {
        Events {
            pump: pump,
            now: ImmediateEvents::new()
        }
    }
    
    pub fn pump(&mut self) {
        self.now = ImmediateEvents::new();
    
        for event in self.pump.poll_iter() {
            use ::sdl2::event::Event::*;
            use ::sdl2::keyboard::Keycode::*;

            match event {
                _ => {}
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Then, we wrap everything inside a single, gigantic macro named `struct_events`:

```rust
macro_rules! struct_events {
    ( /* PATTERN */ ) => {
        use ::sdl2::event::EventPump;
        

        pub struct ImmediateEvents;

        impl ImmediateEvents {
            pub fn new() -> ImmediateEvents {
                ImmediateEvents
            }
        }


        pub struct Events<'p> {
            pump: EventPump<'p>,
            pub now: ImmediateEvents,
        }

        impl<'p> Events<'p> {
            pub fn new(pump: EventPump<'p>) -> Events<'p> {
                Events {
                    pump: pump,
                    now: ImmediateEvents::new()
                }
            }
            
            pub fn pump(&mut self) {
                self.now = ImmediateEvents::new();
            
                for event in self.pump.poll_iter() {
                    use ::sdl2::event::Event::*;
                    use ::sdl2::keyboard::Keycode::*;

                    match event {
                        _ => {}
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

We will figure out the pattern later. For the moment, we have to modify our
`main.rs` file to account of two things: first, we have to call the macro we
just defined in order to get an `Events` structure; second, we cannot rely on
`events.quit` and `events.key_escape` existing, at least for the next few
minutes. The resulting main file is the following:

```rust
extern crate sdl2;

// #[macro_use] asks the compiler to import the macros defined in the `events`
// module. This is necessary because macros cannot be namespaced -- macro
// expansion happens before the concept of namespace even starts to _exist_ in
// the compilation timeline.
#[macro_use] mod events;

// We cannot call functions at top-level. However, `struct_events` is not your
// usual function: it's a macro. Which means that you can use a macro to do
// pretty much anything _normal_ code would.
struct_events!();

use sdl2::pixels::Color;

fn main() {
    let mut sdl_context = sdl2::init().video()
        .build().unwrap();
    
    let window = sdl_context.window("ArcadeRS Shooter", 800, 600)
        .position_centered().opengl()
        .build().unwrap();
    
    let mut renderer = window.renderer()
        .accelerated()
        .build().unwrap();
    
    let mut events = Events::new(sdl_context.event_pump());
    
    'game_loop: loop {
        events.pump();
        
        // We put `true` to make sure that the loop stops. We will put back a
        // condition based on events soon enough.
        if true {
            break 'game_loop;
        }
        
        renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(0, 0, 0));
        renderer.clear();
        renderer.present();
    }
}
```

It is to be noted that, from now on, I will explain the program mostly through
comments (lots of them), and much less through text &mdash; especially once we
start to get 200+ lines long files. This ain't your _guessing game_ tutorial
anymore! In general, you can simply delete the comments, and so will I. This
means that, between two excerpts, the logic may be pretty similar but the
comments, totally different.

Now, let's focus on the _pattern_ of our macro. We want to be able to insert a
list of keyboard events and have the Rust preprocessor generate a structure for
us, which takes care of the logic and the copy-pasting automagically. We also
would like for it to be obvious and extendable, if possible by using named
arguments (and it _is_ possible). The first version of the pattern is:

```rust
(
    keyboard: { $( $k_alias:ident : $k_sdl:ident ),* }
)
=> {
```

In `main.rs`, then, we get a macro call that looks something like that:

```rust
struct_events!(
    keyboard: {
        key_escape: Escape
    }
);
```

Your code should now compile successfully and running the program should give...
nothing. Or rather, it shows a window, but terminates automatically after a few
milliseconds.

Let us now _use_ the identifiers we have just added to the pattern:

```rust
macro_rules! struct_events {
    (
        keyboard: { $( $k_alias:ident : $k_sdl:ident ),* }
    )
    => {
        use ::sdl2::event::EventPump;
        

        pub struct ImmediateEvents {
            // For all keyboard event, we have an Option<bool>
            // Some(true)  => Was just pressed
            // Some(false) => Was just released
            // None        => Nothing happening _now_
            $( pub $k_alias: Option<bool> ),*
        }

        impl ImmediateEvents {
            pub fn new() -> ImmediateEvents {
                ImmediateEvents {
                    // When reinitialized, nothing has yet happened, so all are
                    // set to None
                    $( $k_alias: None ),*
                }
            }
        }


        pub struct Events<'p> {
            pump: EventPump<'p>,
            pub now: ImmediateEvents,
            
            // true  => pressed
            // false => not pressed
            $( pub $k_alias: bool ),*
        }

        impl<'p> Events<'p> {
            pub fn new(pump: EventPump<'p>) -> Events<'p> {
                Events {
                    pump: pump,
                    now: ImmediateEvents::new(),
                    
                    // By default, initialize every key with _not pressed_
                    $( $k_alias: false ),*
                }
            }
            
            pub fn pump(&mut self) {
                self.now = ImmediateEvents::new();
            
                for event in self.pump.poll_iter() {
                    use ::sdl2::event::Event::*;
                    use ::sdl2::keyboard::Keycode::*;

                    match event {
                        KeyDown { keycode, .. } => match keycode {
                            // $( ... ),* containing $k_sdl and $k_alias means:
                            //   "for every element ($k_alias : $k_sdl) pair,
                            //    check whether the keycode is Some($k_sdl). If
                            //    it is, then set the $k_alias fields to true."
                            $(
                                Some($k_sdl) => {
                                    // Prevent multiple presses when keeping a key down
                                    // Was previously not pressed?
                                    if !self.$k_alias {
                                        // Key pressed
                                        self.now.$k_alias = Some(true);
                                    }
                                
                                    self.$k_alias = true;
                                }
                            ),* // and add a comma after every option
                            _ => {}
                        },
                        
                        KeyUp { keycode, .. } => match keycode {
                            $(
                                Some($k_sdl) => {
                                    // Key released
                                    self.now.$k_alias = Some(false);
                                    self.$k_alias = false;
                                }
                            ),*
                            _ => {}
                        },
                    
                        _ => {}
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

There we go! And now, one could add as much keyboard listeners as he'd like,
as long as they are defined in `rust-sdl2`. For example, if you'd like to
listen to the up and down arrows (for example, for moving in a menu), you
could simply change the macro invocation to:

```rust
struct_events!(
    keyboard: {
        key_escape: Escape,
        key_up: Up,
        key_down: Down
    }
);
```

I must point out, however, that unlike the `struct`, `match`, ... built-ins
provided by Rust, our macro does _not_ allow trailing commas.

Let's now say that we would like to know whether escape _was just pressed_.
In which case, we would like to close our window (break out of the main loop).
Then, we could change, in `main.rs`...

```rust
if true {
    break 'game_loop;
}
```

... to...

```rust
if events.now.key_escape == Some(true) {
    break 'game_loop;
}
```

So, we're pretty much done with handling the keyboard. Hurray! Still, we can't
listen to `Quit` events, nor to other devices, such as the mouse. We will not
go too deep into the rabbit hole for such a simple project. However, I would
at least like to be able to do the first task. Now that the heavy-lifting is
done and the foundations, solid, it seems to be a good time to do so.


## Moar inputs!!

Let us now handle the case where, like with `Quit`, we only care about whether
or not the event _happened_ or _matches a pattern exactly_. As such, we will
store this state in a boolean value. Unlike key presses, though, we cannot get
`NOT(pattern)`. This means that we can neither turn back the value to `false`,
nor assign a `Some(false)` value to `self.now.whatever`.

With this in mind, it does not make much sense to add a value directly to our
`events` object, nor does it make sense to have an _immediate_ attribute of
type `Option<bool>`. What _would_ make sense would be to store the state only
in an _immediate_ attribute of type `bool`.

Also, because it can be used as a _catch-all_ for events that our system
doesn't know about, we will handle it at the end of our macro.

So, let's do it, shall we! We first change the pattern to:

```rust
(
    keyboard: { $( $k_alias:ident : $k_sdl:ident ),* },
    
    // Match against a pattern
    else: { $( $e_alias:ident : $e_sdl:pat ),* }
)
```

In the `main.rs` file, we can now ask to listen to the `Quit` event:

```rust
struct_events!(
    keyboard: {
        key_escape: Escape,
        key_up: Up,
        key_down: Down
    },
    else: {
        quit: Quit { .. }
    }
);
```

All that is needed from us now is to handle it generically inside the macro. I
challenge you to try to do it yourself. Go ahead! It feels fair to give you a
few hints, so here they are:

  * Expanding with `$( ... ),*` inside `struct` fields does not actually add a comma at the end, so you should use `$( ... , )*` instead.
  * A `pat` argument can be placed anywhere a pattern would in normal code.

Try it out: fail, succeed, and see what you come up with.

...

I'm assuming that you had a go at it. So, without further due, here's my
solution. First, change the `ImmediateEvents` attributes and constructor as
such:

```rust
pub struct ImmediateEvents {
    $( pub $k_alias : Option<bool> , )*
    $( pub $e_alias : bool ),*
}

impl ImmediateEvents {
    pub fn new() -> ImmediateEvents {
        ImmediateEvents {
            $( $k_alias: None , )*
            $( $e_alias: false ),*
        }
    }
}
```

Then, right before the `_ => {}` in the main `match` statement, insert:

```rust
$(
    $e_sdl => {
        self.now.$e_alias = true;
    }
)*,
```

If all works out as expected, it should compile and you should now be able to
use the good ol' conditional structure that we previously added in `main`,
that is:

```rust
if true == events.now.quit || Some(true) == events.now.key_escape {
    break 'game_loop;
}
```


## Conclusion

If everything went according to plan, you now know more than you did previously
about macros and the way that we can use them to do ADD, or
_awesomeness-driven-development_. In fact, this is just the tip of the iceberg.
It turns out that you can implement entire design patterns in such a way that
they feel almost _native_ to the language.

I will soon write an [article](#) about implementing the _builder pattern_,
that we saw previously, using a macro. The result is stunning:

```rust
builder!(UserBuilder => User, {
    name: String,
    age: u32
});

impl User {
    // ...
}
```

All you need is to import a crate, `#[macro_use]` the module and enjoy!
This is one of the reason why I love Rust so much: it allows the community to
grow the language, and the `!` (pronounced "_bang_") allows to differentiate
between library and compiler business. This is simply gorgeous!

[Next time](/2015/188/arcaders-1-4), we will take a look at
_traits_, another one of Rust's dominating features. Soon enough, we will
program an extendable menu system using yet another macro and trait objects. By
the time we get to the actual game logic and rendering, we will have a solid
foundation and you should be able to do most of the work yourself, gaze at your
creation, and perhaps create a couple other small games on your own.

But I'm getting ahead of myself! The next tutorials should come in a close
future. Until then, keep rusting!
