After the _break_ of the previous article, it is time to learn about yet another
plugin available for SDL2: sdl2\_ttf. Using it, we will render the text of a main
menu for our game, and learn in the process about caching, passing data between
views, and as one would expect, text rendering.

Let's get started!


## Yet another plugin

Let's modify our `Cargo.toml` file's dependencies once more:

```
[dependencies]
sdl2 = "0.13"
sdl2_image = "0.3"
sdl2_ttf = "0.13.1"
```

The way in which we initialize this plugin is pretty standard: the `init` function
returns a handler which takes care of cleaning everything. As such, in
`phi/mod.rs`, we have:

```rust
// Initialize SDL2
let sdl_context = ::sdl2::init().unwrap();
let video = sdl_context.video().unwrap();
let mut timer = sdl_context.timer().unwrap();
let _image_context = ::sdl2_image::init(::sdl2_image::INIT_PNG).unwrap();
let _ttf_context = ::sdl2_ttf::init().unwrap();
```

We can now use it. Because we are about to have a many-views project, though,
let's move the content of `views/mod.rs` into a new file `views/game.rs` and
change the content of the (now empty) `views/mod.rs` file to:

```rust
pub mod game;
pub mod main_menu;
```

Let us now create the _main menu_ we were talking about!


## Back to a blank canvas

Before we create our menu, let's pretend that we already did and instantiate it
in the `main.rs` file, as we import the sdl2\_ttf crate:

```rust
extern crate sdl2;
extern crate sdl2_image;
extern crate sdl2_ttf;

mod phi;
mod views;


fn main() {
    ::phi::spawn("ArcadeRS Shooter", |phi| {
        Box::new(::views::main_menu::MainMenuView::new(phi))
    });
}
```

Now that this is out of the way, we can focus on creating this `MainMenuView`.
In `views/main_menu.rs`, insert:

```rust
use phi::{Phi, View, ViewAction};
use sdl2::pixels::Color;


pub struct MainMenuView;

impl MainMenuView {
    pub fn new(phi: &mut Phi) -> MainMenuView {
        MainMenuView
    }
}

impl View for MainMenuView {
    fn render(&mut self, phi: &mut Phi, elapsed: f64) -> ViewAction {
        if phi.events.now.quit || phi.events.now.key_escape == Some(true) {
            return ViewAction::Quit;
        }

        // Clear the screen
        phi.renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(0, 0, 0));
        phi.renderer.clear();

        ViewAction::None
    }
}
```

Your code should now compile and produce a black screen. We will soon fill it
up, but first...


## Rendering text

Let's start by formalizing what we mean by a _main menu_. It is a discrete list
of actions which the player may take &mdash; New Game, Options, Quit, etc. Each
of these options, when chosen, allows us to interact with the main game loop,
either by leaving the game or by showing a new view.

We could define an _action_ as:

```rust
struct Action {
    /// The function which should be executed if the action is chosen.
    //? We store it in a Box because, as we saw previously, `Fn` is a trait,
    //? and we may only interact with unsized data through a pointer.
    func: Box<Fn(&mut Phi) -> ViewAction>,

    /// The sprite which is rendered when the player does not focus on this
    /// action's label.
    idle_sprite: Sprite,

    /// The sprite which is rendered when the player "focuses" a label with the
    /// directional keys.
    hover_sprite: Sprite,
}
```

The next part is to generate those sprites from a label. To render text, we must
go through the following procedure:

```rust
// Load the font from a file
let font = ::sdl2_ttf::Font::from_file(Path::new(font_path), size).unwrap();

// For historical reasons, we must first render the text as a `Surface`
// (a purely 2D image).
let surface = font.render(text, ::sdl2_ttf::blended(color)).unwrap()

// Then, we turn this image into a `Texture`, which is more efficient.
let texture = self.renderer.create_texture_from_surface(&surface).unwrap();

// Finally, we make a sprite out of this texture.
let sprite = Sprite::new(texture);
```

That's a lot of things to do every time, and we're still not correctly handling
the possibility of any step failing. So we're going to add a utility function to
`Phi` (it will become clear why soon enough):

```rust
use self::gfx::Sprite;
use sdl2::render::Renderer;
use sdl2::pixels::Color;
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::path::Path;

//? ...

impl<'window> Phi<'window> {
    //? ...

    pub fn ttf_str_sprite(&mut self, text: &str, font_path: &'static str, size: i32, color: Color) -> Option<Sprite> {
        //? We start by trying to load the requested font.
        ::sdl2_ttf::Font::from_file(Path::new(font_path), size).ok()
            //? We must wrap the next steps in a closure because borrow checker.
            //? More precisely, `font` must live at least until the texture is
            //? created.
            .and_then(|font| font
                //? If this worked, we try to create a surface from the font.
                .render(text, ::sdl2_ttf::blended(color)).ok()
                //? If this worked, we try to make this surface into a texture.
                .and_then(|surface| self.renderer.create_texture_from_surface(&surface).ok())
                //? If this worked, we load
                .map(Sprite::new))
        }
}
```

Notice how we used both `and_then` and `map` in this example. Both take in an
option as `self`, and a closure. If the option is `Some(value)`, then they call
the function with the given value; otherwise, they return `None` without further
computation.

The difference lies in the fact that `and_then`'s closure returns, too, an
option, which is passed further down the line, while `map` takes in a function
that cannot fail (such as our trusty `Sprite::new`).

I reckon you should take a look at the documentation for the
[`Option::and_then`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/option/enum.Option.html#method.and_then) and
[`Option::map`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/option/enum.Option.html#method.map)
methods. Specifically, try to understand their signature.


## Make it fast

What we have now works... but perhaps it isn't the most efficient way to do
things. Notably, we must load the font every time we want to create a new
sprite. We may ask the users of our API to provide a `Font` instead:

```rust
pub fn ttf_str_sprite(&mut self, text: &str, font: ::sdl2_ttf::Font, color: Color) -> Option<Sprite>;
```

But for the sake of pedagogy, we will use `Phi` to cache the fonts, as we
announced when we first introduced this type. The first step, then, is to add a
`cached_fonts` attribute to `Phi`:

```rust
pub struct Phi<'window> {
    pub events: Events,
    pub renderer: Renderer<'window>,

    cached_fonts: HashMap<(&'static str, i32), ::sdl2_ttf::Font>,
}

impl<'window> Phi<'window> {
    fn new(events: Events, renderer: Renderer<'window>) -> Phi<'window> {
        Phi {
            events: events,
            renderer: renderer,
            cached_fonts: HashMap::new(),
        }
    }

    //? ...
}
```

Once this is done, we can do some caching magic:

```rust
impl<'window> Phi<'window> {
    //? ...

    /// Renders a string of text as a sprite using the provided parameters.
    pub fn ttf_str_sprite(&mut self, text: &str, font_path: &'static str, size: i32, color: Color) -> Option<Sprite> {
        //? First, we verify whether the font is already cached. If this is the
        //? case, we use it to render the text.
        if let Some(font) = self.cached_fonts.get(&(font_path, size)) {
            return font.render(text, ::sdl2_ttf::blended(color)).ok()
                .and_then(|surface| self.renderer.create_texture_from_surface(&surface).ok())
                .map(Sprite::new)
        }

        //? Otherwise, we start by trying to load the requested font.
        ::sdl2_ttf::Font::from_file(Path::new(font_path), size).ok()
            .and_then(|font| {
                //? If this works, we cache the font we acquired.
                self.cached_fonts.insert((font_path, size), font);
                //? Then, we call the method recursively. Because we know that
                //? the font has been cached, the `if` block will be executed
                //? and the sprite will be appropriately rendered.
                self.ttf_str_sprite(text, font_path, size, color)
            })
    }
}
```

Now that we have a mechanism for rendering text, we can get back to menu making!


## Main menu

We have defined what we mean by an _action_:

```rust
struct Action {
    /// The function which should be executed if the action is chosen.
    //? We store it in a Box because, as we saw previously, `Fn` is a trait,
    //? and we may only interact with unsized data through a pointer.
    func: Box<Fn(&mut Phi) -> ViewAction>,

    /// The sprite which is rendered when the player does not focus on this
    /// action's label.
    idle_sprite: Sprite,

    /// The sprite which is rendered when the player "focuses" a label with the
    /// directional keys.
    hover_sprite: Sprite,
}
```

However, we still have no way to _create_ one. Let's change that. For both
`idle_sprite` and `hover_sprite`, we will use the same font:
[belligerent.ttf](/assets/belligerent.ttf), and `hover_sprite` will be slightly
bigger.

```rust
impl Action {
    fn new(phi: &mut Phi, label: &'static str, func: Box<Fn(&mut Phi) -> ViewAction>) -> Action {
        Action {
            func: func,
            idle_sprite: phi.ttf_str_sprite(label, "assets/belligerent.ttf", 32, Color::RGB(220, 220, 220)).unwrap(),
            hover_sprite: phi.ttf_str_sprite(label, "assets/belligerent.ttf", 38, Color::RGB(255, 255, 255)).unwrap(),
        }
    }
}
```

Let's start with a menu where no element is focused:

```rust
pub struct MainMenuView {
    actions: Vec<Action>,
}

impl MainMenuView {
    pub fn new(phi: &mut Phi) -> MainMenuView {
        MainMenuView {
            actions: vec![
                Action::new(phi, "New Game", Box::new(|phi| {
                    ViewAction::ChangeView(Box::new(::views::game::ShipView::new(phi)))
                })),
                Action::new(phi, "Quit", Box::new(|_| {
                    ViewAction::Quit
                })),
            ],
        }
    }
}

impl View for MainMenuView {
    fn render(&mut self, phi: &mut Phi, elapsed: f64) -> ViewAction {
        if phi.events.now.quit || phi.events.now.key_escape == Some(true) {
            return ViewAction::Quit;
        }


        // Clear the screen.
        phi.renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(0, 0, 0));
        phi.renderer.clear();

        for (i, action) in self.actions.iter().enumerate() {
            let (w, h) = action.idle_sprite.size();
            phi.renderer.copy_sprite(&action.idle_sprite, Rectangle {
                x: 32.0,
                //? We place every element under the previous one.
                y: 32.0 + 48.0 * i as f64,
                w: w,
                h: h,
            });
        }


        ViewAction::None
    }
}
```

Now, we would like to allow the user to manipulate a `selected` variable
using his keyboard. Moreover, we would like the user to activate whichever
option is currently selected using the space bar. And why not center the labels
horizontally while we're at it!

```rust
pub struct MainMenuView {
    actions: Vec<Action>,
    //? We're using i8 instead of usize (0..) so that we do not have underflow
    //? errors when decrementing it on key_up.
    selected: i8,
}

impl MainMenuView {
    pub fn new(phi: &mut Phi) -> MainMenuView {
        MainMenuView {
            actions: vec![
                Action::new(phi, "New Game", Box::new(|phi| {
                    ViewAction::ChangeView(Box::new(::views::game::ShipView::new(phi)))
                })),
                Action::new(phi, "Quit", Box::new(|phi| {
                    ViewAction::Quit
                })),
            ],
            //? Start with the option at the top of the screen, with index 0.
            selected: 0,
        }
    }
}

impl View for MainMenuView {
    fn render(&mut self, phi: &mut Phi, elapsed: f64) -> ViewAction {
        if phi.events.now.quit || phi.events.now.key_escape == Some(true) {
            return ViewAction::Quit;
        }


        // Execute the currently selected option.
        if phi.events.now.key_space == Some(true) {
            //? We must use the (self.attr_which_by_the_way_is_a_closure)(phi)
            //? syntax so that Rust doesn't confuse it with the invocation of
            //? a method called `func`.
            //?
            //? This is necessary because Rust allows a method to share the same
            //? name as an attribute -- a feature which is useful for defining
            //? accessors.
            return (self.actions[self.selected as usize].func)(phi);
        }

        // Change the selected action using the keyboard.
        if phi.events.now.key_up == Some(true) {
            self.selected -= 1;
            //? If we go past the value at the top of the list, we go 'round
            //? to the bottom.
            if self.selected < 0 {
                self.selected = self.actions.len() as i8 - 1;
            }
        }

        if phi.events.now.key_down == Some(true) {
            self.selected += 1;
            //? If we go past the value at the bottom of the list, we go 'round
            //? to the top.
            if self.selected >= self.actions.len() as i8 {
                self.selected = 0;
            }
        }


        // Clear the screen.
        phi.renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(0, 0, 0));
        phi.renderer.clear();

        // Render the labels in the menu
        let (win_w, win_h) = phi.output_size();

        for (i, action) in self.actions.iter().enumerate() {
            if self.selected as usize == i {
                let (w, h) = action.hover_sprite.size();
                phi.renderer.copy_sprite(&action.hover_sprite, Rectangle {
                    //? I suggest trying to draw this on a sheet of paper.
                    x: (win_w - w) / 2.0,
                    y: 32.0 + 48.0 * i as f64,
                    w: w,
                    h: h,
                });
            } else {
                let (w, h) = action.idle_sprite.size();
                phi.renderer.copy_sprite(&action.idle_sprite, Rectangle {
                    x: (win_w - w) / 2.0,
                    y: 32.0 + 48.0 * i as f64,
                    w: w,
                    h: h,
                });
            }
        }


        ViewAction::None
    }
}
```

Guess what: our main menu _works_! And if you press the space bar while
"New Game" is selected, we get back to our good ol' spaceship.

![A working, though ugly, main menu](/images/arcade-12.png)


## Aesthetics

As I said, our main menu _works_... but we can do much better than that. For one
thing, it would be nice to center our menu vertically, and add a bit of color,
and make the bigger label grow both up and down, centering it vertically in its
allowed space. Oh, and we could use our animated backgrounds to add some
movement.

Yeah... that wasn't one thing. Let's not waste any more time, then!

I feel like it would be easier to understand all of this using a picture, so
here's the final product, with some annotations. I'm sure you can do something
similar on paper.

![A beautiful, annotated menu](/images/arcade-13.png)

And here's the corresponding code:

```rust
// Definitions for the menu's layout
let (win_w, win_h) = phi.output_size();
let label_h = 50.0;
let border_width = 3.0;
let box_w = 360.0;
let box_h = self.actions.len() as f64 * label_h;
let margin_h = 10.0;

// Render the border of the colored box which holds the labels
phi.renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(70, 15, 70));
phi.renderer.fill_rect(Rectangle {
    w: box_w + border_width * 2.0,
    h: box_h + border_width * 2.0 + margin_h * 2.0,
    x: (win_w - box_w) / 2.0 - border_width,
    y: (win_h - box_h) / 2.0 - margin_h - border_width,
}.to_sdl().unwrap());

// Render the colored box which holds the labels
phi.renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(140, 30, 140));
phi.renderer.fill_rect(Rectangle {
    w: box_w,
    h: box_h + margin_h * 2.0,
    x: (win_w - box_w) / 2.0,
    y: (win_h - box_h) / 2.0 - margin_h,
}.to_sdl().unwrap());

// Render the labels in the menu
for (i, action) in self.actions.iter().enumerate() {
    if self.selected as usize == i {
        let (w, h) = action.hover_sprite.size();
        phi.renderer.copy_sprite(&action.hover_sprite, Rectangle {
            w: w,
            h: h,
            x: (win_w - w) / 2.0,
            y: (win_h - box_h + label_h - h) / 2.0 + label_h * i as f64,
        });
    } else {
        let (w, h) = action.idle_sprite.size();
        phi.renderer.copy_sprite(&action.idle_sprite, Rectangle {
            w: w,
            h: h,
            x: (win_w - w) / 2.0,
            y: (win_h - box_h + label_h - h) / 2.0 + label_h * i as f64,
        });
    }
}
```

The nice thing with using constants and not hard-coded numbers is that it is
easy to try out new designs by changing the values of some bindings. It would
also allow us to change those values at run-time &mdash; to change `margin_h`
and `box_w` as the screen's size changes, or even according to time. For
instance,

```rust
pub struct MainMenuView {
    actions: Vec<Action>,
    selected: i8,
    elapsed: f64,
}

//? ...

self.elapsed += elapsed * 4.0;
let box_w = 360.0 + 5.0 * self.elapsed.sin();
let margin_h = 10.0 + 5.0 * (self.elapsed + 1.0).sin();
```

... produces wobbly rectangles. Hopefully, you get the idea. More _useful_ would
be making the labels grow and shrink in size through an animation whenever they
are selected or deselected. I'm not going to try this out, but you can if you
wish!

And while we're talking about things to do, try and activate the selected action
when pressing the `Return` key. It's not very hard and you'll find the answer in
the snapshot.

Finally, let's add our trusty backgrounds behind the menu box. Move the
`Background` type to a new file `views/shared.rs` where we will put utilities
and graphical components used by multiple views but which do not belong to
`Phi`. Do not forget to import `Background` in `views/game.rs`, to mark its
attributes public, and to declare the `shared` module in `views/mod.rs`.

Once this is done, adding the backgrounds is a matter of copying and pasting:

```rust
//? views/main_menu.rs

use views::shared::Background;

//? ...

pub struct MainMenuView {
    actions: Vec<Action>,
    selected: i8,

    bg_back: Background,
    bg_middle: Background,
    bg_front: Background,
}

impl MainMenuView {
    pub fn new(phi: &mut Phi) -> MainMenuView {
        MainMenuView {
            actions: vec![
                Action::new(phi, "New Game", Box::new(|phi| {
                    ViewAction::ChangeView(Box::new(::views::game::ShipView::new(phi)))
                })),
                Action::new(phi, "Quit", Box::new(|phi| {
                    ViewAction::Quit
                })),
            ],
            selected: 0,

            bg_back: Background {
                pos: 0.0,
                vel: 20.0,
                sprite: Sprite::load(&mut phi.renderer, "assets/starBG.png").unwrap(),
            },

        }
    }
}

//? ...

//? Clear the screen.

// Render the backgrounds
self.bg_back.render(&mut phi.renderer, elapsed);
self.bg_middle.render(&mut phi.renderer, elapsed);
self.bg_front.render(&mut phi.renderer, elapsed);

//? Definitions for the menu's layout
```

It looks _much_ better now, doesn't it!

## Conclusion

That was quite an article, wasn't it! We went all the way from a single view to
a many-views project with a main menu. It's still not a complete game, but we're
getting there.

Interested by a final challenge? Try to make the background in the game (and in
the main menu) keep the same position whenever we change the view, and make it
so that, when we press `Escape` in the game view, we are transported back to the
main menu.

Spoilers: you will probably have to fight the borrow checker and change a few
definitions in the process. Needless to say that it's a good exercise of
refactoring. I myself moved all the backgrounds to a `shared::BgSet` structure
to save some typing because it was getting somewhat messy.

The best tip I may give you is to read the error messages. They may be cryptic
at times, but the compiler is better than you at finding errors, so you should
trust it.

Anyways! My implementation will be in the snapshot.
Good luck!
