Now that we got the machinery for manipulating images working, we can take make
our game _look better_ by adding parallax backgrounds. Through this process, we
will take a closer look at how `renderer.copy` behaves. This should be much
lighter than the previous article, and get easier as we go forth because we've
already taken care of most of the heavy-lifting.

Let's go then.


## Preparing the data

Let's start by creating a new structure called `Background` which will take care
of the whole _parallax_ business. Because this is specific to our game, we will
add it to `views/mod.rs`:

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
struct Background {
    pos: f64,
    // The amount of pixels moved to the left every second
    vel: f64,
    sprite: Sprite,
}
```

We will use the following images to represent the backgrounds:

<p><img src="/images/starBG.png" alt="Furthest background" style="background:#000;" /></p>
<p><img src="/images/starMG.png" alt="Closest background" style="background:#000;" /></p>
<p><img src="/images/starFG.png" alt="Foreground" style="background:#000;" /></p>

Now that we have those, we can modify the main view:

```rust
pub struct ShipView {
    player: Ship,

    bg_back: Background,
    bg_middle: Background,
    bg_front: Background,
}

impl ShipView {
    pub fn new(phi: &mut Phi) -> ShipView {
        let spritesheet = Sprite::load(&mut phi.renderer, "assets/spaceship.png").unwrap();
        let mut sprites = Vec::with_capacity(9);

        for y in 0..3 {
            for x in 0..3 {
                sprites.push(spritesheet.region(Rectangle {
                    w: SHIP_W,
                    h: SHIP_H,
                    x: SHIP_W * x as f64,
                    y: SHIP_H * y as f64,
                }).unwrap());
            }
        }

        ShipView {
            player: Ship {
                rect: Rectangle {
                    x: 64.0,
                    y: 64.0,
                    w: SHIP_W,
                    h: SHIP_H,
                },
                sprites: sprites,
                current: ShipFrame::MidNorm,
            },

            bg_back: Background {
                pos: 0.0,
                vel: 20.0,
                sprite: Sprite::load(&mut phi.renderer, "assets/starBG.png").unwrap(),
            },
            bg_middle: Background {
                pos: 0.0,
                vel: 40.0,
                sprite: Sprite::load(&mut phi.renderer, "assets/starMG.png").unwrap(),
            },
            bg_front: Background {
                pos: 0.0,
                vel: 80.0,
                sprite: Sprite::load(&mut phi.renderer, "assets/starFG.png").unwrap(),
            },
        }
    }
}
```

While we're at it, let's use some wishful thinking and draw our backgrounds in
the `ShipView::render`. We'll also hide the ship's bounding box using the
`DEBUG` constant.

```rust
const DEBUG: bool = false;

//? ...

// Clear the scene
phi.renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(0, 0, 0));
phi.renderer.clear();

// Render the Backgrounds
self.bg_back.render(&mut phi.renderer, elapsed);
self.bg_middle.render(&mut phi.renderer, elapsed);

// Render the bounding box (for debugging purposes)
if DEBUG {
    phi.renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(200, 200, 50));
    phi.renderer.fill_rect(self.player.rect.to_sdl().unwrap());
}

// Render the ship
phi.renderer.copy_sprite(
    &self.player.sprites[self.player.current as usize],
    self.player.rect);

// Render the foreground
self.bg_front.render(&mut phi.renderer, elapsed);
```

Let us now fully flesh out `Background::render`.


## Rendering a background

We would like our background to move at the same _logical velocity_ no matter
the size of the screen. To do so...

```rust
use sdl2::render::Renderer;

//? ...

impl Background {
    fn render(&mut self, renderer: &mut Renderer, elapsed: f64) {
        // We define a logical position as depending solely on the time and the
        // dimensions of the image, not on the screen's size.
        let size = self.sprite.size();
        self.pos += self.vel * elapsed;
        if self.pos > size.0 {
            self.pos -= size.0;
        }

        // We determine the scale ratio of the window to the sprite.
        let (win_w, win_h) = renderer.output_size().unwrap();
        let scale = win_h as f64 / size.1;

        // We render as many copies of the background as necessary to fill
        // the screen.
        let mut physical_left = -self.pos * scale;

        while physical_left < win_w as f64 {
            //? While the left of the image is still inside of the window...
            renderer.copy_sprite(&self.sprite, Rectangle {
                x: physical_left,
                y: 0.0,
                w: size.0 * scale,
                h: win_h as f64,
            });

            physical_left += size.0 * scale;
        }
    }
}
```

I'm sure you can figure out how this works!

You should be able to run the game, now!

## Conclusion

Well, that was short an sweet, wasn't it! [Next time](/arcaders/arcaders-1-9),
we're going to do something a bit different: we'll take a break from our game's
logic and add a main menu to our game.

This will be the occasion to take care of this _variant is never used:
`ChangeView`_ you should be getting right now.

Until then, keep rusting!
