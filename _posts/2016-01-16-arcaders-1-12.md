This is the twelfth part of a series whose objective is to explore the Rust
programming language through the development of a simple, old-school shooter.
It is composed of 16 parts, excluding the [introduction](/arcaders/arcaders-1-0/):

1. [A simple window](/arcaders/arcaders-1-1/), where we install SDL2
2. [Event handling](/arcaders/arcaders-1-2/), where we discuss lifetimes
3. [More event handling](/arcaders/arcaders-1-3/), where we discuss macros
4. [Views](/arcaders/arcaders-1-4/), where we learn about boxes, pattern matching, trait objects, and dynamic dispatch
5. [Switching views](/arcaders/arcaders-1-5/), where we use boxes, pattern matching, trait objects, and dynamic dispatch
6. [A moving rectangle](/arcaders/arcaders-1-6/), where we draw _things_
7. [Sprites](/arcaders/arcaders-1-7/), where we create our player's ship
8. [Backgrounds](/arcaders/arcaders-1-8/), where we handle resizing, scale and translate through time
9. [Main menu](/arcaders/arcaders-1-9), where we play with textures and Rust's vectors
10. [Asteroid attack!](/arcaders/arcaders-1-10), where we render animated asteroids
11. [Shooting bullets](/arcaders/arcaders-1-11), where we explore iterators
12. [Brawl, at last!](/arcaders/arcaders-1-12), where we make objects interact and explode
13. [« Boom! »](#), where we play sound.
14. [Variety](#), where we create more enemies
15. [Difficulty](#), where we manage the difficulty level and the score
16. [High score & wrap-up](#), where we play with the file-system and enhance our main menu


In the previous article, we allowed the player to shoot a bunch of bullets. This
means that we almost have everything we need for brawl to begin: weapons and
enemies. The final steps, which we're going to do in this article, are to detect
collisions, manage resources, and make things explode.

Before that, though, it seems to me that naming is a bit off, especially for
`ShipView`. This was nice at first, but we're now _way_ further than that. To
fix this, just replace every occurrence of `ShipView` by `GameView` in
`views/game.rs` and `views/main_menu.rs`.

Done? Alright, let's move forward!


## Asteroids O' Plenty

It's a bit silly to have our user fight a single asteroid. We're going to fix
this in this section, first by updating the recently renamed `GameView` so that
it holds a vector of asteroids:

```rust
pub struct GameView {
    player: Ship,
    bullets: Vec<Box<Bullet>>,
    asteroids: Vec<Asteroid>,
    bg: BgSet,
}

impl GameView {
    //? ...

    pub fn with_backgrounds(phi: &mut Phi, bg: BgSet) -> GameView {
        //? ...

        GameView {
            //? ...

            bullets: vec![],
            asteroids: vec![],

            //? ...
        }
    }
}
```

We should also update `Asteroid` so that `update` doesn't move it back to the
right of the screen, but destroys it when it leaves it to the left instead. We
will also add a `rect()` method for collision detection. The API is now quite
similar to that of `Bullet`, though not identical:

```rust
impl Asteroid {
    //? ...

    fn update(mut self, dt: f64) -> Option<Asteroid> {
        self.rect.x -= dt * self.vel;
        self.sprite.add_time(dt);

        if self.rect.x <= -ASTEROID_SIDE {
            None
        } else {
            Some(self)
        }
    }

    fn render(&self, phi: &mut Phi) {
        if DEBUG {
            // Render the bounding box
            phi.renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(200, 200, 50));
            phi.renderer.fill_rect(self.rect().to_sdl().unwrap());
        }

        phi.renderer.copy_sprite(&self.sprite, self.rect);
    }

    fn rect(&self) -> Rectangle {
        self.rect
    }
}
```

As such, we will manage the asteroids similarly to how we did for the bullets in
the previous article:

```rust
impl View for GameView {
    fn render(&mut self, phi: &mut Phi, elapsed: f64) -> ViewAction {
        //? ...

        // Update the asteroids
        self.asteroids =
            ::std::mem::replace(&mut self.asteroids, vec![])
            .into_iter()
            .filter_map(|asteroid| asteroid.update(elapsed))
            .collect();

        //? ...

        //? Notice the similarity between how we use both entities.

        for bullet in &self.bullets {
            bullet.render(phi);
        }

        for asteroid in &self.asteroids {
            asteroid.render(phi);
        }

        //? ...
    }
}
```

The next question to ask, then, is "how can we create an asteroid?" It would be
silly to load the same image every time, as we have done when we were only using
a single asteroid:

```rust
//? Our previous solution, which isn't sufficient anymore.

impl Asteroid {
    fn new(phi: &mut Phi) -> Asteroid {
        let mut asteroid =
            Asteroid {
                sprite: Asteroid::get_sprite(phi, 1.0),
                rect: Rectangle {
                    w: 0.0,
                    h: 0.0,
                    x: 0.0,
                    y: 0.0,
                },
                vel: 0.0,
            };

        asteroid.reset(phi);
        asteroid
    }

    //? ...

    fn get_sprite(phi: &mut Phi, fps: f64) -> AnimatedSprite {
        let asteroid_spritesheet = Sprite::load(&mut phi.renderer, ASTEROID_PATH).unwrap();
        let mut asteroid_sprites = Vec::with_capacity(ASTEROIDS_TOTAL);

        //? [Prepare the sprites]

        AnimatedSprite::with_fps(asteroid_sprites, fps)
    }

    //? ...
}
```

The answer is twofold. Firstly, we notice that cloning an asteroid has
a negligible cost, because it only stores a few real numbers and an animated
sprite, which we defined as such:

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
struct AnimatedSprite {
    sprites: Rc<Vec<Sprite>>,
    frame_delay: f64,
    current_time: f64,
}
```

That is, it itself only contains two real numbers and the address of a vector
containing the frames. This means that our structure is so cheap to copy that
the overhead (both mental and performance-wise) of an optimized solution is not
worth the trouble.

Secondly, we need _something_ to hold the original animated sprite. There are
many ways to do this, some more complicated than others. Because our sprites are
declared with `Rc` &mdash; which implements `Drop` and is neither `Sync` nor
`Send` &mdash; we cannot do this:

```rust
static mut ASTEROID_SPRITE: Option<AnimatedSprite> = None;

//? [Get the spritesheet]

ASTEROID_SPRITESHEET = Asteroid::get_sprite(...);
```

This means that we will have to store _some kind_ of information in our view in
order to create new asteroids. For this task, I chose to use a _factory type_
which will manufacture asteroids for us and store/generate the required
information. We could have done the same thing by storing the animated sprite
directly in `GameView`, but this has the advantage of limiting the amount of
information that we leak to the outside world &mdash; and it would probably
compile to similar machine code anyway.

```rust
impl Asteroid {
    fn factory(phi: &mut Phi) -> AsteroidFactory {
        // Read the asteroid's image from the filesystem and construct an
        // animated sprite out of it.

        let asteroid_spritesheet = Sprite::load(&mut phi.renderer, ASTEROID_PATH).unwrap();
        let mut asteroid_sprites = Vec::with_capacity(ASTEROIDS_TOTAL);

        for yth in 0..ASTEROIDS_HIGH {
            for xth in 0..ASTEROIDS_WIDE {
                if ASTEROIDS_WIDE * yth + xth >= ASTEROIDS_TOTAL {
                    break;
                }

                asteroid_sprites.push(
                    asteroid_spritesheet.region(Rectangle {
                        w: ASTEROID_SIDE,
                        h: ASTEROID_SIDE,
                        x: ASTEROID_SIDE * xth as f64,
                        y: ASTEROID_SIDE * yth as f64,
                    }).unwrap());
            }
        }

        // Return the data required to build an asteroid
        AsteroidFactory {
            sprite: AnimatedSprite::with_fps(asteroid_sprites, 1.0),
        }
    }

    //? ...
}


struct AsteroidFactory {
    sprite: AnimatedSprite,
}

impl AsteroidFactory {
    fn random(&self, phi: &mut Phi) -> Asteroid {
        let (w, h) = phi.output_size();

        // FPS in [10.0, 30.0)
        let sprite = self.sprite.clone();
        sprite.set_fps(::rand::random::<f64>().abs() * 20.0 + 10.0);

        Asteroid {
            sprite: sprite,

            // In the screen vertically, and over the right of the screen
            // horizontally.
            rect: Rectangle {
                w: ASTEROID_SIDE,
                h: ASTEROID_SIDE,
                x: w,
                y: ::rand::random::<f64>().abs() * (h - ASTEROID_SIDE),
            },

            // vel in [50.0, 150.0)
            vel: ::rand::random::<f64>().abs() * 100.0 + 50.0,
        }
    }
}
```

Now, all we have to do is to add it to our view and use it, say, just after we
create the bullets shot by the player.

```rust
impl View for GameView {
    fn render() {
        //? ...

        // Allow the player to shoot after the bullets are updated, [...]
        if phi.events.now.key_space == Some(true) {
            self.bullets.append(&mut self.player.spawn_bullets());
        }

        // Randomly create an asteroid about once every 100 frames, that is,
        // a bit more often than once every two seconds.
        if ::rand::random::<usize>() % 100 == 0 {
            self.asteroids.push(self.asteroid_factory.random(phi));
        }

        //? ...
    }
}
```

You can verify that everything works correctly by adding...

```rust
println!("{}", self.asteroids.len());
```

... somewhere in the body of the function. It should increment when an asteroid
is created, and decrement once it leaves the screen through the left.

<!--
Secondly, we need _something_ to hold the original animated sprite. In an
object-oriented language such as Java, you might define a new data type:

```rust
struct AsteroidBuilder {
    sprite: AnimatedSprite,
}

impl AsteroidBuilder {
    fn spawn(&self, x: f64, y: f64) -> Asteroid { ... }
}
```

Or manually create the asteroid in the

However, this is not necessary in Rust, because of its functional heritage.
Instead, we will use _closures_. If you've worked with JavaScript of OCaml,
you've likely become used to if. If you haven't, though, brace yourself, because
this is is great.

Ever wondered why there are different kinds of functions. Well, it's because of
a property of closures, that is, functions created with the following syntax:

```rust
|arguments| { body }
```

< -- Have we?
We've already seen that `Fn` allows you to access values from its enclosing
scope, this is what allowed us to __TODO__.
This works because the closure stores a reference toward whatever value you use
in its body &mdash; which implies that a closure cannot outlive the scope in
which it was defined.

If you modify a value from the outside world, what you get is an `FnMut`. It
works similarly to `Fn` in that it stores an `&mut` to the value. This means
that, while you have a mutable closure refers to a value from the enclosing
scope, you cannot read or write to that value from outside of the closure.
Remember: _you can have many immutable references, XOR a single mutable reference_.

However, neither of these cases satisfy us. We do not want to store a reference
to the animated sprite, instead we wish to _move_ the animated sprite itself.
__TODO__, we have yet another alternative: `FnOnce`, which does exactly this:

```rust
struct GameView {
    //? ...
    asteroid_builder: FnOnce(f64, f64) -> Asteroid,
}

impl GameView {
    //? ...

    fn new_with_backgrounds() // TODO
}
```

## Collision detection

In the sixth article, ["A moving rectangle"](/arcaders/arcaders-1-6/), we
created the `Rectangle` structure. Toward the end, I quickly showed you a
utility method, `overlaps`, and promised that we would see how to use it in
due time. Up until now, all it's done to us is trigger an `unused method`
warning, but this will soon be a story of the past. Indeed, it is now time for
brawl to begin.

We will use the `overlaps` method like this:

```rust
asteroid.rect().overlaps(bullet.rect())
```

When it is true, it means that the asteroid and the bullets are colliding with
one another. For this game, we would like all entities which are in a situation
of collision to annihilate. For example, if two bullets hit the same asteroid at
the same time, we would like _both_ bullets to disappear.

To do this, we will wrap the bullets and the asteroids in a `MaybeAlive`
structure which also contains a flag indicating whether the value is still
_alive_, as in _it has not (yet) been destroyed in a collision_:

```rust
pub struct MaybeAlive<T> {
    pub alive: bool,
    pub value: T,
}

impl<T> MaybeAlive<T> {
    /// Checks whether the value is still alive. If this is the case, then
    /// return `Some(value)`; otherwise, return `None`.
    pub fn as_option(self) -> Option<T> {
        if self.alive {
            Some(self.value)
        } else {
            None
        }
    }
}
```

Because this data type might be useful for many games that are not shooters, you
should insert this in `phi/data.rs` and `use` it in the module containing our
view.

Now that this is done, let the brawl begin:

```rust
//? ...

// Update the asteroids
self.asteroids = //? ...


// Collision detection

//? We keep track of whether or not the player is alive.
let mut player_alive = true;

//? First, go through the bullets and wrap them in a `MaybeAlive`, so that we
//? can keep track of which got into a collision and which did not.
let mut transition_bullets: Vec<_> =
    ::std::mem::replace(&mut self.bullets, vec![])
    .into_iter()
    .map(|bullet| MaybeAlive { alive: true, value: bullet })
    .collect();

self.asteroids =
    ::std::mem::replace(&mut self.asteroids, vec![])
    .into_iter()
    .filter_map(|asteroid| {
        // By default, the asteroid has not been in a collision.
        let mut asteroid_alive = true;

        for bullet in &mut transition_bullets {
            //? Notice that we refer to the bullet as `bullet.value`
            //? because it has been wrapped in `MaybeAlive`.
            if asteroid.rect().overlaps(bullet.value.rect()) {
                asteroid_alive = false;
                //? We go through every bullet and "kill" those that collide
                //? with the asteroid. We do this for every asteroid.
                bullet.alive = false;
            }
        }

        // The player's ship is destroyed if it is hit by an asteroid.
        // In which case, the asteroid is also destroyed.
        if asteroid.rect().overlaps(self.player.rect) {
            asteroid_alive = false;
            player_alive = false;
        }

        //? Then, we use the magic of `filter_map` to keep only the asteroids
        //? that didn't explode.
        if asteroid_alive {
            Some(asteroid)
        } else {
            None
        }
    })
    .collect();

//? Finally, we use once again the magic of `filter_map` to keep only the
//? bullets that are still alive.
self.bullets = transition_bullets.into_iter()
    .filter_map(MaybeAlive::as_option)
    .collect();


// TODO
// For the moment, we won't do anything about the player dying. This will be
// the subject of a future episode.
if !player_alive {
    println!("The player's ship has been destroyed.");
}

// Allow the player to shoot after the bullets are updated, so that,
// when rendered for the first time, they are drawn wherever they
// spawned.
if phi.events.now.key_space == Some(true) {
    self.bullets.append(&mut self.player.spawn_bullets());
}

//? ...
```

![Bullets are destroyed upon impact and spawn randomly](/images/arcade-19.png)

You should now be able to destroy asteroids with you bullets. The only problem
is that, well, it's not very impressive. Fortunately, as Michael Bay has taught
us, when something is boring, you just gotta add explosions to it. Let's do that
right now!


## Michael Bay Strikes Back

Like the asteroids, our explosions will be made out of an animated sprite and a
bounding box. The main differences with asteroids (and pretty much every other
entity that we have designed so far) are that they will not be moving and that
they do not interact with other entities: they are created, play their
animation, and finally disappear.

First, let's take care of the explosions' spritesheet. Here it is:

![The spritesheet for an explosion](/images/explosion.png)

You should store it in the `assets` directory as `explosion.png`. Here are a few
useful constants about it:

```rust
const EXPLOSION_PATH: &'static str = "assets/explosion.png";
const EXPLOSIONS_WIDE: usize = 5;
const EXPLOSIONS_HIGH: usize = 4;
const EXPLOSIONS_TOTAL: usize = 17;
const EXPLOSION_SIDE: f64 = 96.0;
const EXPLOSION_FPS: f64 = 16.0;
const EXPLOSION_DURATION: f64 = 1.0 / EXPLOSION_FPS * EXPLOSIONS_TOTAL as f64;
```

Because, like with `Asteroid`, we do not want to read the spritesheet every time
we create an explosion, we will use the same technique. This time, however, we
will not position the explosion depending on the size of the window, but instead
we will say that its center is the same as that of the asteroid. This might seem
a bit overkill, considering that explosions and asteroids have the same size,
but this approach can be easily extends to more enemies.

Here's how we might implement the factory:

```rust
struct Explosion {
    sprite: AnimatedSprite,
    rect: Rectangle,

    //? Keep how long its been arrived, so that we destroy the explosion once
    //? its animation is finished.
    alive_since: f64,
}

impl Explosion {
    fn factory(phi: &mut Phi) -> ExplosionFactory {
        // Read the asteroid's image from the filesystem and construct an
        // animated sprite out of it.

        let explosion_spritesheet = Sprite::load(&mut phi.renderer, EXPLOSION_PATH).unwrap();
        let mut explosion_sprites = Vec::with_capacity(EXPLOSIONS_TOTAL);

        for yth in 0..EXPLOSIONS_HIGH {
            for xth in 0..EXPLOSIONS_WIDE {
                if EXPLOSIONS_WIDE * yth + xth >= EXPLOSIONS_TOTAL {
                    break;
                }

                explosion_sprites.push(
                    explosion_spritesheet.region(Rectangle {
                        w: EXPLOSION_SIDE,
                        h: EXPLOSION_SIDE,
                        x: EXPLOSION_SIDE * xth as f64,
                        y: EXPLOSION_SIDE * yth as f64,
                    }).unwrap());
            }
        }

        // Return the data required to build an asteroid
        ExplosionFactory {
            sprite: AnimatedSprite::with_fps(explosion_sprites, EXPLOSION_FPS),
        }
    }
}


struct ExplosionFactory {
    sprite: AnimatedSprite,
}

impl ExplosionFactory {
    fn at_center(&self, center: (f64, f64)) -> Explosion {
        //? ...
    }
}
```

One thing should bother you about this code, though: we're repeating ourselves,
a lot. Moreover, considering that loading animated sprites using this method
will probably be common in many games, it would be better to make this a
functionality of our `phi` library.

In `phi/gfx.rs`, insert the following:

```rust
/// A bunch of options for loading the frames of an animation from a spritesheet
/// stored at `image_path`.
//? You might notice the lifetime annotation. As always, this means: the file's
//? path should stay alive longer than the configuration that references it.
//? Because it will, more often than not, store a string allocated statically --
//? as we'll be doing here -- ensuring this should be mostly trivial.
pub struct AnimatedSpriteDescr<'a> {
    pub image_path: &'a str,
    pub total_frames: usize,
    pub frames_high: usize,
    pub frames_wide: usize,
    pub frame_w: f64,
    pub frame_h: f64,
}

//? ...

impl AnimatedSprite {
    //? ...

    pub fn load_frames(phi: &mut Phi, descr: AnimatedSpriteDescr) -> Vec<Sprite> {
        // Read the asteroid's image from the filesystem and construct an
        // animated sprite out of it.

        let spritesheet = Sprite::load(&mut phi.renderer, descr.image_path).unwrap();
        let mut frames = Vec::with_capacity(descr.total_frames);

        for yth in 0..descr.frames_high {
            for xth in 0..descr.frames_wide {
                if descr.frames_wide * yth + xth >= descr.total_frames {
                    break;
                }

                frames.push(
                    spritesheet.region(Rectangle {
                        w: descr.frame_w,
                        h: descr.frame_h,
                        x: descr.frame_w * xth as f64,
                        y: descr.frame_h * yth as f64,
                    }).unwrap());
            }
        }

        frames
    }

    //? ...
}
```

Then, we can import `AnimatedSpriteDescr` in `views/game.rs` and rewrite the
asteroid and the explosion's factory methods as:

```rust
impl Asteroid {
    fn factory(phi: &mut Phi) -> AsteroidFactory {
        AsteroidFactory {
            sprite: AnimatedSprite::with_fps(
                AnimatedSprite::load_frames(phi, AnimatedSpriteDescr {
                    image_path: ASTEROID_PATH,
                    total_frames: ASTEROIDS_TOTAL,
                    frames_high: ASTEROIDS_HIGH,
                    frames_wide: ASTEROIDS_WIDE,
                    frame_w: ASTEROID_SIDE,
                    frame_h: ASTEROID_SIDE,
                }), 1.0),
        }
    }

    //? ...
}

impl Explosion {
    fn factory(phi: &mut Phi) -> ExplosionFactory {
        ExplosionFactory {
            sprite: AnimatedSprite::with_fps(
                AnimatedSprite::load_frames(phi, AnimatedSpriteDescr {
                    image_path: EXPLOSION_PATH,
                    total_frames: EXPLOSIONS_TOTAL,
                    frames_high: EXPLOSIONS_HIGH,
                    frames_wide: EXPLOSIONS_WIDE,
                    frame_w: EXPLOSION_SIDE,
                    frame_h: EXPLOSION_SIDE,
                }), EXPLOSION_FPS),
        }
    }
}
```

Notice that the only reason for creating the `AnimatedSpriteDescr` is so we
could use named parameters. This approach has both pros and cons. First, it's
more verbose than what you might have in another language (say, Elm, although it
still beats Java/C++), which I can deal with, but it also clutters the API that
we expose to other developers. On the other hand, it's much clearer than a list
of nameless parameters, and we could easily create an extensible API by using an
enumeration:

```rust
pub enum ASDescr<'a> {
    // Let `AnimatedFrame` determine how many frames are part of the image.
    LoadAll {
        image_path: &'a str,
        frame_w: f64,
        frame_h: f64,
        read_flow: HorizontalThenVertical,
    },

    // Loads a predetermined amount of frames, starting from the top-left one.
    //? This is what we had before.
    LoadFromStart {
        pub image_path: &'a str,
        pub total_frames: usize,
        pub frames_high: usize,
        pub frames_wide: usize,
        pub frame_w: f64,
        pub frame_h: f64,
    },

    //? ...
}
```

As always, the approach that you'll take will depend on what you're trying to
achieve. I will stick to `AnimatedSpriteDescr` for this project, but you may
implement this API yourself.

Let's leave this tangent and get back to business, shall we! Now that we have an
explosion factory, we must tell it how to generate an instance:

```rust
impl ExplosionFactory {
    fn at_center(&self, center: (f64, f64)) -> Explosion {
        // FPS in [10.0, 30.0)
        let mut sprite = self.sprite.clone();

        Explosion {
            sprite: sprite,

            // In the screen vertically, and over the right of the screen
            // horizontally.
            rect: Rectangle::with_size(EXPLOSION_SIDE, EXPLOSION_SIDE)
                    .center_at(center),

            alive_since: 0.0,
        }
    }
}
```

For this to work, we must extend a bit our `Rectangle`'s API in `phi/data.rs`:

```rust
impl Rectangle {
    //? ...

    /// Generate a rectangle with the provided size, with its top-left corner
    /// at (0, 0).
    pub fn with_size(w: f64, h: f64) -> Rectangle {
        Rectangle {
            w: w,
            h: h,
            x: 0.0,
            y: 0.0,
        }
    }


    /// Centers
    pub fn center_at(self, center: (f64, f64)) -> Rectangle {
        Rectangle {
            x: center.0 - self.w / 2.0,
            y: center.1 - self.h / 2.0,
            ..self
        }
    }

    /// Return the center of the rectangle.
    pub fn center(self) -> (f64, f64) {
        let x = self.x + self.w / 2.0;
        let y = self.y + self.h / 2.0;
        (x, y)
    }

    //? ...
}
```

Let's then create the API for interacting with explosions. As I said earlier, it
is quite similar to what we've done before, so I won't spend much time on it:

```rust
struct Explosion {
    sprite: AnimatedSprite,
    rect: Rectangle,
    alive_since: f64,
}

impl Explosion {
    //? ...

    fn update(mut self, dt: f64) -> Option<Explosion> {
        self.alive_since += dt;
        self.sprite.add_time(dt);

        if self.alive_since >= EXPLOSION_DURATION {
            None
        } else {
            Some(self)
        }
    }

    fn render(&self, phi: &mut Phi) {
        phi.renderer.copy_sprite(&self.sprite, self.rect);
    }
}
```

Finally, we insert explosions in our game view and blow stuff up:

```rust
pub struct GameView {
    player: Ship,
    bullets: Vec<Box<Bullet>>,
    asteroids: Vec<Asteroid>,
    asteroid_factory: AsteroidFactory,
    //? We have a vector of explosions...
    explosions: Vec<Explosion>,
    explosion_factory: ExplosionFactory,
    bg: BgSet,
}

impl GameView {
    //? ...

    pub fn with_backgrounds(phi: &mut Phi, bg: BgSet) -> GameView {
        //? ...

        GameView {
            //? ...

            bullets: vec![],
            asteroids: vec![],
            asteroid_factory: Asteroid::factory(phi),
            explosions: vec![],
            explosion_factory: Explosion::factory(phi),

            //? ...
        }
    }
}

impl View for GameView {
    fn render(&mut self, phi: &mut Phi, elapsed: f64) -> ViewAction {
        //? ...

        // Update the asteroids
        self.asteroids = //? ...

        // Update the explosions
        self.explosions =
            ::std::mem::replace(&mut self.explosions, vec![])
            .into_iter()
            .filter_map(|explosion| explosion.update(elapsed))
            .collect();

        //? ...

        self.asteroids =
            ::std::mem::replace(&mut self.asteroids, vec![])
            .into_iter()
            .filter_map(|asteroid| {
                // By default, the asteroid has not been in a collision.
                let mut asteroid_alive = true;

                for bullet in &mut transition_bullets {
                    if asteroid.rect().overlaps(bullet.value.rect()) {
                        asteroid_alive = false;
                        bullet.alive = false;
                    }
                }

                // The player's ship is destroyed if it is hit by an asteroid.
                // In which case, the asteroid is also destroyed.
                if asteroid.rect().overlaps(self.player.rect) {
                    asteroid_alive = false;
                    player_alive = false;
                }

                if asteroid_alive {
                    Some(asteroid)
                } else {
                    // Spawn an explosive wherever an asteroid was destroyed.
                    self.explosions.push(
                        self.explosion_factory.at_center(
                            asteroid.rect().center()));
                    None
                }
            })
            .collect();

        //? ...

        for explosion in &self.explosions {
            explosion.render(phi);
        }

        //? ...
    }
}
```

And... that's it! Your game should now work properly:

## Cleaning up

Our code has accumulated a bit of dust since we started working on it. Not only
was `ShipView` ill-named, but there are parts of our code that should simply be
abstracted better; here, I'm talking about our player's ship.

First, rename `Ship` to `Player` (a quick case-sensitive search-and-replace did
the trick for me). Incidentally, `ShipFrame` should become `PlayerFrame`. Then,
let our player take care of its own initialization:

```rust
const PLAYER_PATH: &'static str = "assets/spaceship.png";
const PLAYER_W: f64 = 43.0;
const PLAYER_H: f64 = 39.0;

//? ...

impl Player {
    pub fn new(phi: &mut Phi) -> Player {
        // Get the spaceship's sprites
        let spritesheet = Sprite::load(&mut phi.renderer, PLAYER_PATH).unwrap();
        let mut sprites = Vec::with_capacity(9);

        for y in 0..3 {
            for x in 0..3 {
                sprites.push(spritesheet.region(Rectangle {
                    w: PLAYER_W,
                    h: PLAYER_H,
                    x: PLAYER_W * x as f64,
                    y: PLAYER_H * y as f64,
                }).unwrap());
            }
        }

        Player {
            // Spawn the player at the center of the screen, vertically.
            rect: Rectangle {
                x: 64.0,
                y: (phi.output_size().1 - PLAYER_H) / 2.0,
                w: PLAYER_W,
                h: PLAYER_H,
            },
            sprites: sprites,
            current: PlayerFrame::MidNorm,
            cannon: CannonType::RectBullet,
        }
    }

    //? ...
}
```

Then, add an `update` method that takes care of event handling:

```rust
impl Ship {
    //? ...

    pub fn update(&mut self, phi: &mut Phi, elapsed: f64) {
        // Change the player's cannons

        if phi.events.now.key_1 == Some(true) {
            self.cannon = CannonType::RectBullet;
        }

        if phi.events.now.key_2 == Some(true) {
            self.cannon = CannonType::SineBullet {
                amplitude: 10.0,
                angular_vel: 15.0,
            };
        }

        if phi.events.now.key_3 == Some(true) {
            self.cannon = CannonType::DivergentBullet {
                a: 100.0,
                b: 1.2,
            };
        }

        // Move the player's ship

        let diagonal =
            (phi.events.key_up ^ phi.events.key_down) &&
            (phi.events.key_left ^ phi.events.key_right);

        let moved =
            if diagonal { 1.0 / 2.0f64.sqrt() }
            else { 1.0 } * PLAYER_SPEED * elapsed;

        let dx = match (phi.events.key_left, phi.events.key_right) {
            (true, true) | (false, false) => 0.0,
            (true, false) => -moved,
            (false, true) => moved,
        };

        let dy = match (phi.events.key_up, phi.events.key_down) {
            (true, true) | (false, false) => 0.0,
            (true, false) => -moved,
            (false, true) => moved,
        };

        self.rect.x += dx;
        self.rect.y += dy;

        // The movable region spans the entire height of the window and 70% of its
        // width. This way, the player cannot get to the far right of the screen, where
        // we will spawn the asteroids, and get immediately eliminated.
        //
        // We restrain the width because most screens are wider than they are high.
        let movable_region = Rectangle {
            x: 0.0,
            y: 0.0,
            w: phi.output_size().0 as f64 * 0.70,
            h: phi.output_size().1 as f64,
        };

        // If the player cannot fit in the screen, then there is a problem and
        // the game should be promptly aborted.
        self.rect = self.rect.move_inside(movable_region).unwrap();

        // Select the appropriate sprite of the ship to show.
        self.current =
            if dx == 0.0 && dy < 0.0       { ShipFrame::UpNorm }
            else if dx > 0.0 && dy < 0.0   { ShipFrame::UpFast }
            else if dx < 0.0 && dy < 0.0   { ShipFrame::UpSlow }
            else if dx == 0.0 && dy == 0.0 { ShipFrame::MidNorm }
            else if dx > 0.0 && dy == 0.0  { ShipFrame::MidFast }
            else if dx < 0.0 && dy == 0.0  { ShipFrame::MidSlow }
            else if dx == 0.0 && dy > 0.0  { ShipFrame::DownNorm }
            else if dx > 0.0 && dy > 0.0   { ShipFrame::DownFast }
            else if dx < 0.0 && dy > 0.0   { ShipFrame::DownSlow }
            else { unreachable!() };
    }
}
```

As a final change on `Player`, let us allow it to render itself and make
`spawn_bullets` public:

```rust
impl Player {
    //? ...

    pub fn render(&self, phi: &mut Phi) {
        // Render the bounding box (for debugging purposes)
        if DEBUG {
            phi.renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(200, 200, 50));
            phi.renderer.fill_rect(self.rect.to_sdl().unwrap());
        }

        // Render the ship's current sprite.
        phi.renderer.copy_sprite(
            &self.sprites[self.current as usize],
            self.rect);
    }

    pub fn spawn_bullets(&self) -> Vec<Box<Bullet>> {
        //? ...
    }

    //? ...
}
```

Let's now take a look at what this means for `GameView`. First, the `new` static
method that we used for developing it is no longer relevant and can be removed.
Then, the `with_backgrounds` method is now much shorter than it was:

```rust
impl GameView {
    pub fn with_backgrounds(phi: &mut Phi, bg: BgSet) -> GameView {
        GameView {
            // Entities
            player: Player::new(phi),

            bullets: vec![],
            asteroids: vec![],
            asteroid_factory: Asteroid::factory(phi),
            explosions: vec![],
            explosion_factory: Explosion::factory(phi),

            // Scenery
            bg: bg,
        }
    }
}
```

Then, the whole of event handling and moving of the ship becomes:

```rust
// Update the player
self.player.update(phi, elapsed);
```

And we replace the rendering of the ship (bounding box and picture) by:

```rust
// Render the entities

self.player.render(phi);

//? ...
```

Because a lot of lines are taken by the bullets, and because they pretty much
make up their own _concept_ in our game, we will move them to
[`views/bullets.rs`](https://github.com/jadpole/jadpole.github.io/blob/master/code/arcaders-1-12/src/views/bullets.rs),
and add the `bullets` module to `views/mod.rs`.

However, if we want to create bullets without making every field public, we also have
to transfer `CannonType` and a `spawn_bullets` method which we shall define as such:

```rust
pub fn spawn_bullets(cannon: CannonType,
                     cannons_x: f64,
                     cannon1_y: f64,
                     cannon2_y: f64) -> Vec<Box<Bullet>>
{
    //? Insert what we had previously in `Ship/Player::spawn_bullet`
    match cannon {
        CannonType::RectBullet => //? ...
        CannonType::SineBullet { amplitude, angular_vel } => //? ...
        CannonType::DivergentBullet { a, b } => //? ...
    }
}
```

Then, `Player::spawn_bullets` becomes:

```rust
use views::bullets::*;

//? ...

impl Player {
    //? ...

    pub fn spawn_bullets(&self) -> Vec<Box<Bullet>> {
        let cannons_x = self.rect.x + 30.0;
        let cannon1_y = self.rect.y + 6.0;
        let cannon2_y = self.rect.y + PLAYER_H - 10.0;

        spawn_bullets(self.cannon, cannons_x, cannon1_y, cannon2_y)
    }
}
```

You should verify that your code still compiles properly. Otherwise, follow the errors
and try to fix them. This should be clean enough for what will follow.


## Conclusion

We now almost have a working game, hurray! There are still some things left to
do: playing sound, keeping track of the score, adding more enemies, ... but other than
that we're approaching the end. It would also be nice to take a look at advanced event
handling and to add a multiplayer mode, and I will probably write bonus parts about
those, but __ArcadeRS 1.*__ itself will soon be complete.

All of that to say: we're almost done!
In the [next article](#), we will add sound to our game. But until then, keep
rustaceanotizationating!
