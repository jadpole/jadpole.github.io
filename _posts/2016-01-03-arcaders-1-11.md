This is the eleventh part of a series whose objective is to explore the Rust
programming language through the development of a simple, old-school shooter.
It is composed of 16 parts, excluding the [introduction](/arcaders/arcaders-1-0/):

1. [A simple window](/arcaders/arcaders-1-1/), where we install SDL2
2. [Event handling](/arcaders/arcaders-1-2/), where we discuss lifetimes
3. [More event handling](/arcaders/arcaders-1-3/), where we discuss macros
4. [Views](/arcaders/arcaders-1-4/), where we learn about boxes, pattern matching, trait objects, and dynamic dispatch
5. [Switching views](/arcaders/arcaders-1-5/), where we use boxes, pattern matching, trait objects, and dynamic dispatch
6. [A moving rectangle](/arcaders/arcaders-1-6/), where we draw _things_
7. [Sprites](/arcaders/arcaders-1-7/), where we create our player's ship
8. [Backgrounds](/arcaders/arcaders-1-8/), where we handle resizing, scale and translate through time
9. [Main menu](/arcaders/arcaders-1-9), where we play with textures and Rust's vectors
10. [Asteroid attack!](/arcaders/arcaders-1-10), where we render animated asteroids
11. [Shooting bullets](/arcaders/arcaders-1-11), where we explore iterators
12. [Brawl, at last!](/arcaders/arcaders-1-12), where we make objects interact and explode
13. [« Boom! »](#), where we play sound.
14. [Variety](#), where we create more enemies
15. [Difficulty](#), where we manage the difficulty level and the score
16. [High score & wrap-up](#), where we play with the file-system and enhance our main menu

In the previous article, we created the first enemy for our player to fight.
However, this is pretty useless considering that our player cannot yet... fight.
Let's fix that!

In this article, we will learn about iterators and use them to describe the
behaviour of simple bullets. Then, we will see how to allow bullets of many
kinds to exist at once using trait objects. Finally, we will use this system to
create a bunch of somewhat-interesting bullets.


## Simple bullets

The first step in designing the default bullet will be to define the attributes
that compose it. In this case, it's pretty simple: all bullets will have the
same velocity, so there is no need to store it every one; we only need to know
its bounding box.

```rust
//? The velocity shared by all bullets, in pixels per second.
const BULLET_SPEED: f64 = 240.0;

//? The size of the rectangle which will represent the bullet.
const BULLET_W: f64 = 8.0;
const BULLET_H: f64 = 4.0;

//? ...

#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
struct RectBullet {
    rect: Rectangle,
}
```

The second step is to define the interface through which one might access the
bullet. To fulfill this task, we must implement four functionalities:
creating, moving and rendering bullets, and getting their bounding boxes for
collision detection (in the next article). However, because the ship is the
only entity that can create bullets, we will let it do this job.

```rust
impl RectBullet {
    /// Update the bullet.
    /// If the bullet should be destroyed, e.g. because it has left the screen,
    /// then return `None`.
    /// Otherwise, return `Some(update_bullet)`.
    fn update(mut self, phi: &mut Phi, dt: f64) -> Option<Self> {
        let (w, _) = phi.output_size();
        self.rect.x += BULLET_SPEED * dt;

        // If the bullet has left the screen, then delete it.
        if self.rect.x > w {
            None
        } else {
            Some(self)
        }
    }

    /// Render the bullet to the screen.
    fn render(self, phi: &mut Phi) {
        // We will render this kind of bullet in yellow.
        //? This is exactly how we drew our first moving rectangle in the
        //? seventh part of this series.
        phi.renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(230, 230, 30));
        phi.renderer.fill_rect(self.rect.to_sdl().unwrap());
    }

    /// Return the bullet's bounding box.
    fn rect(&self) -> Rectangle {
        self.rect
    }
}
```

Then, we will modify our ship so that it can shoot bullets. Our ship does not
shoot them from its tip, though, it has two cannons instead. Therefore,
`Ship::spawn_bullets` will return a vector of bullets:

```rust
impl Ship {
    fn spawn_bullets(&self) -> Vec<RectBullet> {
        let cannons_x = self.rect.x + 30.0;
        let cannon1_y = self.rect.y + 6.0;
        let cannon2_y = self.rect.y + SHIP_H - 10.0;

        // One bullet at the tip of every cannon
        //? We could modify the initial position of the bullets by matching on
        //? `self.current : ShipFrame`, however there is not much point to this
        //? pedagogy-wise. You can try it out if you want. ;)
        vec![
            RectBullet {
                rect: Rectangle {
                    x: cannons_x,
                    y: cannon1_y,
                    w: BULLET_W,
                    h: BULLET_H,
                }
            },
            RectBullet {
                rect: Rectangle {
                    x: cannons_x,
                    y: cannon2_y,
                    w: BULLET_W,
                    h: BULLET_H,
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

This should do the trick! The last step, for this section, is to add them to
the view. This is where it starts to get interesting:

```rust
pub struct ShipView {
    player: Ship,
    bullets: Vec<RectBullet>,
    asteroid: Asteroid,
    bg: BgSet,
}

impl ShipView {
    //? ...

    pub fn with_backgrounds(phi: &mut Phi, bg: BgSet) -> ShipView {
        //? ...

        ShipView {
            player: Ship {
                //? ...
            },

            //? We start with no bullets. Because the size of the vector will
            //? change drastically throughout the program, there is not much
            //? point in giving it a capacity.
            bullets: vec![],

            asteroid: Asteroid::new(phi),

            bg: bg,
        }
    }
}

impl View for ShipView {
    fn render(&mut self, phi: &mut Phi, elapsed: f64) -> ViewAction {
        //? ...

        // Select the appropriate sprite of the ship to show.
        self.player.current = //? ...

        // Update the bullets
        self.bullets =
            self.bullets.iter()
            .filter_map(|bullet| bullet.update(phi, elapsed))
            .collect();

        // Update the asteroid
        self.asteroid.update(phi, elapsed);

        // Allow the player to shoot after the bullets are updated, so that,
        // when rendered for the first time, they are drawn wherever they
        // spawned.
        //
        //? In this case, we ensure that the new bullets are drawn at the tips
        //? of the cannons.
        //?
        //? The `Vec::append` method moves the content of `spawn_bullets` at
        //? the end of `self.bullets`. After this is done, the vector returned
        //? by `spawn_bullets` will be empty.
        if phi.events.now.key_space == Some(true) {
            self.bullets.append(&mut self.player.spawn_bullets());
        }

        //? ...

        // Render the ship
        phi.renderer.copy_sprite(/*? ... ?*/);

        // Render the bullets
        for bullet in &self.bullets {
            bullet.render(phi);
        }

        //? ...
    }
}
```

Here's how it looks:

![The ship shooting bullets in straight lines](/images/arcade-16.png)

I would like to direct your intention to two things. First, consider the way in
which we iterate over the bullets to render them:

```rust
for bullet in &bullets {
    bullet.render(phi);
}
```

To understand how this works, we must take a closer look at the desugaring of
the [`for` loop](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/for-loops.html). When we iterate
over a value which implements `Iterator`, the loop simply binds the `next()`
value to the left-hand-side. For instance,

```rust
for x in 0..42 {
    do_stuff(x);
}
```

could be rewritten using a [`while let` loop](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/if-let.html#while-let)

```rust
let mut iterated = 0..42;
while let Some(x) = iterated.next() {
    do_stuff(x);
}
```

This is what you might expect when seeing a `for` loop for the first time.
However, another behaviour is available: Rust will implicitly call `into_iter`
when it receives an item that doesn't implement `Iterator`, but does implement
[`IntoIterator`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.IntoIterator.html).
For instance,

```rust
let xs = vec![1, 2, 3];
for x in xs {
    do_stuff(x);
}
```

is equivalent to this:

```rust
let xs = vec![1, 2, 3];
let mut iterated = xs.into_iter();
while let Some(x) = iterated.next() {
    do_stuff(x);
}
```

This is in fact what is happening here, because `&Vec` implements `IntoIterator`:

```rust
use ::std::slice::Iter;

impl<'a, T> IntoIterator for &'a Vec<T> {
    type Item = &'a T;
    type IntoIter = Iter<'a, T>;

    //? Notice that, while we write `self`, we are also implementing a trait
    //? on a reference to `Vec<T>`, that is, `self` is a `&Vec<T>`. We are
    //? therefore not moving anything, even though this is what we might guess
    //? upon reading this code for the first time.
    fn into_iter(self) -> Iter<'a, T> { ... }

    //? When explicitly putting the types in, we have:
    fn into_iter(self: &'a Vec<T>) -> Iter<'a, T> { ... }
}
```

I like this piece of code, because it shows quite nicely how lifetimes can be
used for creating easy-to-use abstractions that cannot leak memory and do not
have a runtime cost. From this code, we get that items of the iterator cannot
outlive the iterator, because both have the same lifetime. Not only that, but
we can see, from its module path, that `Iter` [operates on a slice](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/slice/index.html).
This allows us to make an educated guess as to the implementation of
`into_iter` (cf. [a snippet on the Playground](http://is.gd/kJqJ1y)):

```rust
impl<'a, T> IntoIterator for &'a Vec<T> {
    type Item = &'a T;
    type IntoIter = Iter<'a, T>;

    fn into_iter(self) -> Iter<'a, T> {
        //? It is to be noted that &Vec will be automatically converted to a
        //? slice, so we may take out the `[..]` if we didn't care about being
        //? explicit about this.
        (&vec[..]).into_iter()
    }
}
```

This is not exactly how this is implemented, because libcollections is weird,
but it's a good enough approximation, and it allows me to talk a bit about
[`Index`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Index.html).

You may not always want to iterate over every value of a collection. You might,
for instance, only care about the 10th one. To do this, like most C-family
languages, Rust provides an `Index` syntax to access a single element:

```rust
let value = collection[10];
```

If the index is invalid, say the vector has only 3 items and you ask for the
10th one, Rust will assume that this is a bug and, instead of allowing a
hypothetical cracker to exploit a buffer overflow, it will panic, safely
crashing the process. These bound-checks do not occur when using iterators,
which is why `map` and `filter` are generally faster than a `for i in 0..len`
loop written by-hand.

The nice thing is that, not only does `Vec` implement `Index<usize>`, it also
allows us to get a _range_ of values. When we do so, what we get is not a single
element, but a slice to the region of memory that we selected.

```rust
// Get the 1st and 2nd values
let value = &collection[1..3];

// Get everything from the 1st value
let value = &collection[1..];

// Get everything up to, but not including, the 3rd value
let value = &collection[..3];

// Get a slice to the whole collection
let value = &collection[..];
```

Next, consider the way in which we used iterators for updating the bullets:

```rust
self.bullets =
    //? We get an iterator to the bullets.
    self.bullets.iter()
    //? We go through every bullet and `update` them. If the result of `update`
    //? is `None`, then the bullet will be removed. If the result is `Some(x)`,
    //? then `x` will be included in the new `self.bullets` vector.
    .filter_map(|bullet| bullet.update(phi, elapsed))
    //? Build the vector.
    .collect();
```

This sample uses my favourite iterator method: `filter_map`. It is basically a
shorter and more efficient version of:

```rust
iter.map(f: Fn(T) -> Option<U>)
    .filter(|option_y| match option_y { Some(_) => true, None => false })
```

If you wonder why the order of operations is inverted in `filter_map`'s name,
remember that these methods were inspired by functional languages, for instance
Haskell, in which we would write:

```haskell
-- This is a composition `filter(map(xs))`
filter f (map m collection)
```

Now that we can render a single kind of bullet, it is time to add some variety
to combat. We are now going to see two ways to generalize our understanding of
a _bullet_. This will be the occasion to practice using trait objects and to
learn about _object safety_.


<!-- TODO
and to dabble with a rough approximation of type hierarchies. We will
see where those patterns shine and in which domains they are not the best
solution.

## Using dynamic dispatch

Let us go back to our previous use of the `update` method:

```rust
self.bullets =
    self.bullets.iter()
    .filter_map(|bullet| bullet.update(phi, elapsed))
    .collect();
```

* `update` takes `bullet` by value.
* `RectBullet` derives `Copy`
* `iter()` returns an iterator of _references_ to the elements of `self.bullets`.

Therefore, when translating this sample, the compiler will insert a call to
`clone()` in the third line. It isn't a problem in this case, since `RectBullet`
is such a small data type, however it _does_ prevent us from using the same
technique with trait objects.

This is because of [object safety](http://huonw.github.io/blog/2015/01/object-safety/).
We cannot use dynamic dispatch on methods that return `Self`, because this would
mean returning a type of which we know nothing at compile-time. As you might
have guessed, `Clone` is therefore object-unsafe:

```rust
trait Clone {
    fn clone(&self) -> Self;
}
```

This means that we will have to find another way to update our bullets. But,
before that, let us revisit the way in which we thought about bullets in the
first place. In this new framework, a _bullet_ is something which is stored
behind a pointer at all time, whether it be a reference or a `Box`. A bullet can
be _updated_, that is, we can move it to its position on the next frame. This
requires us to _move_ its value. A bullet can also be _rendered_ to the screen.
Finally, we must be able to get its _bounding box_ for collision detection.
Here's how we could translate this in code:

```rust
trait Bullet {
    /// Update the bullet.
    /// If the bullet should be destroyed, e.g. because it has left the screen,
    /// then return `None`.
    /// Otherwise, return `Some(update_bullet)`.
    //?
    //? Notice how we use `Box<Self>` as the type of `self`. This means: keep
    //? this data behind a pointer, but `move` the pointer. You should note that
    //? *we are not copying the value*: we are only copying the _address_ at
    //? which the value is stored in memory, which has a negligible cost. We can
    //? do this because Rust will automatically free the memory once the `Box`
    //? that contains it is itself destroyed.
    fn update(self: Box<Self>, phi: &mut Phi, dt: f64) -> Option<Box<Bullet>>;

    /// Render the bullet to the screen.
    //? Here, we take an immutable reference to the bullet, because we do not
    //? need to change its value to draw it. This is the same as before.
    fn render(&self, phi: &mut Phi);

    /// Return the bullet's bounding box.
    //? This is also the same as before.
    fn rect(&self) -> Rectangle;
}
```

Now that this is done, we can implement it for our `RectBullet` structure:

```rust
struct RectBullet {
    rect: Rectangle,
}

impl Bullet for RectBullet {
    fn update(mut self: Box<Self>, phi: &mut Phi, dt: f64) -> Option<Box<Bullet>> {
        let (w, _) = phi.output_size();
        self.rect.x += BULLET_SPEED * dt;

        // If the bullet has left the screen, then delete it.
        if self.rect.x > w {
            None
        } else {
            //? This has changed: because `self` is now already a `Box`, there
            //? is no point in boxing it again. This is the only change in a
            //? method's body, though.
            Some(self)
        }
    }

    fn render(&self, phi: &mut Phi) {
        // We will render this kind of bullet in yellow.
        phi.renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(230, 230, 30));
        phi.renderer.fill_rect(self.rect.to_sdl().unwrap());
    }

    fn rect(&self) -> Rectangle {
        self.rect
    }
}
```

Our ship's bullet-shooting utilities have also changed a bit, though not that
much: we simply box the bullets.

```rust
impl Ship {
    fn spawn_bullets(&self) -> Vec<Box<Bullet>> {
        let cannons_x = self.rect.x + 30.0;
        let cannon1_y = self.rect.y + 6.0;
        let cannon2_y = self.rect.y + SHIP_H - 10.0;

        vec![
            Box::new(RectBullet {
                rect: Rectangle {
                    x: cannons_x,
                    y: cannon1_y,
                    w: BULLET_W,
                    h: BULLET_H,
                }
            }),
            Box::new(RectBullet {
                rect: Rectangle {
                    x: cannons_x,
                    y: cannon2_y,
                    w: BULLET_W,
                    h: BULLET_H,
                }
            }),
        ]
    }
}
```

Now, let us use those _abstract bullets_ inside of our view:

```rust
pub struct ShipView {
    player: Ship,
    //? We now store bullets behind pointers.
    bullets: Vec<Box<Bullet>>,
    asteroid: Asteroid,
    bg: BgSet,
}

impl ShipView {
    //? Stays the same...
}

impl View for ShipView {
    fn render(&mut self, phi: &mut Phi, elapsed: f64) -> ViewAction {
        //? ...

        // Update the bullets
        //? TODO

        // Update the asteroid
        self.asteroid.update(phi, elapsed);

        // Allow the player to shoot after the bullets are updated, so that,
        // when rendered for the first time, they are drawn wherever they
        // spawned.
        if phi.events.now.key_space == Some(true) {
            self.bullets.append(&mut self.player.spawn_bullets());
        }

        //? ...

        // Render the bullets
        for bullet in &self.bullets {
            bullet.render(phi);
        }

        //? ...
    }
}
```

You will notice that this is pretty similar to what we had before, except for
two things: we have boxes in the view's data, and a bit of code is missing from
this snippet. Which brings us back to the main question that this article aims
to answer: how does one update the bullets? If you try to use the old solution
that we cooked up:

```rust
self.bullets =
    self.bullets.iter()
    .filter_map(|bullet| bullet.update(phi, elapsed))
    .collect();
```

You will be greeted by an error message:

```
error: cannot move out of borrowed content
 .filter_map(|bullet| bullet.update(phi, elapsed))
                      ^~~~~~
```

My reaction, at first, was to require that bullets implement `Clone` and to
manually insert it:

```rust
trait Bullet: Clone { ... }

#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
struct RectBullet { ... }

//? ...
    .filter_map(|bullet| bullet.clone().update(phi, elapsed))
```

However, as we just saw, this would violate _object safety_, so the compiler will
vehemently protest by printing a wall of error messages that don't make much
sense, for example,

```
error: the trait `views::game::Bullet` is not implemented for the type `views::game::Bullet` [E0277]
```

Moral of the story: if you see such confusing error messages, you are probably
returning `Self` somewhere you shouldn't, or demanding that trait objects
implement `Clone`. Either way, this is one of the areas in which error messages
could be _much_ better.

The solution here is to change `iter()` to `into_iter()`:

```rust
self.bullets =
    self.bullets.into_iter()
    .filter_map(|bullet| bullet.update(phi, elapsed))
    .collect();
```

Once again, though, the compiler tells us that we've made an error, which is why
I used `iter()` in the first place: postponing this discussion to, well, now.
Here's what it's telling us:

```rust
error: cannot move out of borrowed content
 self.bullets.into_iter()
 ^~~~
```

The thing is, this time, the compiler is _wrong_. This is one of the few areas
in which `rustc` is overly conservative. Hopefully, when MIR is a thing, those
will be fixed. Until then, though, there is an easy way to make this work:

```rust
//? Set `self.bullets` to be the empty vector, and put its content inside of
//? `old_bullets`, which we can move without borrow-checker issues.
let old_bullets = ::std::mem::replace(&mut self.bullets, vec![]);

//? Upon assignment, the old value of `self.bullets`, namely the empty vector,
//? will be freed automatically, because its owner no longer refers to it.
//? We can then update the bullet quite simply.
self.bullets =
    old_bullets.into_iter()
    .filter_map(|bullet| bullet.update(phi, elapsed))
    .collect();
```

It's a nice pattern that I find invaluable when updating values with
`into_iter()`, or really anytime I need to change a field in a borrowed
structure.


## Moar bullets!

Now that we can create bullets, let us see how to handle multiple kinds of
bullets at once. We are reaching the end of this series, so we may or may not
create power-ups which set the currently-used bullet. Either way, for the
moment, we will use numbers on the player's keyboard to switch between weapons.
To do this, we must first tell our engine to listen to those:

In `phi/mod.rs`, we should now have:

```rust
struct_events! {
    keyboard: {
        key_escape: Escape,
        key_up: Up,
        key_down: Down,
        key_left: Left,

        key_3: Num3
    },
    else: {
        quit: Quit { .. }
    }
}
```

Before we go forward, just take a few seconds to appreciate the brevity of
`struct_events!`. It took us two articles to write it, but this macro did save
us from _a lot_ of boilerplate in the long run, didn't it? At this point, I
don't even want to imagine going back to the Olde Risky Ways of copy-pasting my
way out of event handling.

Alright, let's get going!

We would like our player to be able to select the bullet it uses. For this, we
will need to define a new algebraic data-type:

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
enum CannonType {
    RectBullet,
}
```

We can do this because `CannonType` creates its own namespace, so `RectBullet`
(the structure) is not the same as `CannonType::RectBullet` (the variant). We
can then add this "cannon" to our ship and switch between bullets when the user
presses on numbers from 1 to 3:

```rust
struct Ship {
    rect: Rectangle,
    sprites: Vec<Sprite>,
    current: ShipFrame,
    cannon: CannonType,
}

impl Ship {
    fn spawn_bullets(&self) -> Vec<Box<Bullet>> {
        let cannons_x = self.rect.x + 30.0;
        let cannon1_y = self.rect.y + 6.0;
        let cannon2_y = self.rect.y + SHIP_H - 10.0;

        match self.cannon {
            CannonType::RectBullet =>
                vec![
                    Box::new(RectBullet {
                        rect: Rectangle {
                            x: cannons_x,
                            y: cannon1_y,
                            w: BULLET_W,
                            h: BULLET_H,
                        }
                    }),
                    Box::new(RectBullet {
                        rect: Rectangle {
                            x: cannons_x,
                            y: cannon2_y,
                            w: BULLET_W,
                            h: BULLET_H,
                        }
                    }),
                ]
        }
    }
}

//? ...

impl ShipView {
    //? ...

    pub fn with_backgrounds(phi: &mut Phi, bg: BgSet) -> ShipView {
        //? ...
        //
        ShipView {
            // Entities
            player: Ship {
                rect: Rectangle {
                    x: 64.0,
                    y: 64.0,
                    w: SHIP_W,
                    h: SHIP_H,
                },
                sprites: sprites,
                current: ShipFrame::MidNorm,
                //? Let `RectBullet` be the default kind of bullet.
                cannon: CannonType::RectBullet,
            },

            bullets: vec![],
            asteroid: Asteroid::new(phi),

            // Scenery
            bg: bg,
        }
    }
}

impl View for ShipView {
    fn render(&mut self, phi: &mut Phi, elapsed: f64) -> ViewAction {
        if phi.events.now.quit {
            return ViewAction::Quit;
        }

        if phi.events.now.key_escape == Some(true) {
            return ViewAction::ChangeView(Box::new(
                ::views::main_menu::MainMenuView::with_backgrounds(
                    phi, self.bg.clone())));
        }


        // Change the player's cannons

        if phi.events.now.key_1 == Some(true) {
            self.player.cannon = CannonType::RectBullet;
        }

        if phi.events.now.key_2 == Some(true) {
            // TODO
        }

        if phi.events.now.key_3 == Some(true) {
            // TODO
        }

        //? ...
    }
}
```

We could also let the cannons on the ship be independent of one another &mdash;
storing them in a tuple should do the trick. I will not do it here, but you can
try to do it if you wish.

The next step after having bullets that go in a straight line is having bullets
that follow a [sinusoidal path](https://www.google.ca/search?q=10*sin%2815.0+*+x%29).
Let's tackle this right now:

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
enum CannonType {
    RectBullet,
    SineBullet { amplitude: f64, angular_vel: f64 },
}

//? ...

struct SineBullet {
    //? Notice that the bounding box isn't stored directly. This means that
    //? we do not keep useless information. It also implies that we must compute
    //? the `sin` function every time we attempt to get the bounding box.
    pos_x: f64,
    origin_y: f64,
    amplitude: f64,
    angular_vel: f64,
    total_time: f64,
}

impl Bullet for SineBullet {
    fn update(mut self: Box<Self>, phi: &mut Phi, dt: f64) -> Option<Box<Bullet>> {
        //? We store the total time...
        self.total_time += dt;

        //? And move at the same speed as regular bullets.
        self.pos_x += BULLET_SPEED * dt;

        // If the bullet has left the screen, then delete it.
        let (w, _) = phi.output_size();

        if self.rect().x > w {
            None
        } else {
            Some(self)
        }
    }

    fn render(&self, phi: &mut Phi) {
        // We will render this kind of bullet in yellow.
        phi.renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(230, 230, 30));
        phi.renderer.fill_rect(self.rect().to_sdl().unwrap());
    }

    fn rect(&self) -> Rectangle {
        //? Just the general form of the sine function, minus the initial time.
        let dy = self.amplitude * f64::sin(self.angular_vel * self.total_time);
        Rectangle {
            x: self.pos_x,
            y: self.origin_y + dy,
            w: BULLET_W,
            h: BULLET_H,
        }
    }
}
```

As you can see, this is pretty similar to what we had with `RectBullet`. We are
also storing the current time, replacing `rect` by `rect()` and making its
bounding box oscillate up and down.

We can then spawn this bullet and use it in our view:

```rust
impl Ship {
    fn spawn_bullets(&self) -> Vec<Box<Bullet>> {
        let cannons_x = self.rect.x + 30.0;
        let cannon1_y = self.rect.y + 6.0;
        let cannon2_y = self.rect.y + SHIP_H - 10.0;

        match self.cannon {
            CannonType::RectBullet =>
                vec![
                    Box::new(RectBullet {
                        rect: Rectangle {
                            x: cannons_x,
                            y: cannon1_y,
                            w: BULLET_W,
                            h: BULLET_H,
                        }
                    }),
                    Box::new(RectBullet {
                        rect: Rectangle {
                            x: cannons_x,
                            y: cannon2_y,
                            w: BULLET_W,
                            h: BULLET_H,
                        }
                    }),
                ],

            CannonType::SineBullet { amplitude, angular_vel } =>
                vec![
                    Box::new(SineBullet {
                        pos_x: cannons_x,
                        origin_y: cannon1_y,
                        amplitude: amplitude,
                        angular_vel: angular_vel,
                        total_time: 0.0,
                    }),
                    Box::new(SineBullet {
                        pos_x: cannons_x,
                        origin_y: cannon2_y,
                        amplitude: amplitude,
                        angular_vel: angular_vel,
                        total_time: 0.0,
                    }),
                ]
        }
    }
}

//? ...

impl View for ShipView {
    fn render(&mut self, phi: &mut Phi, elapsed: f64) -> ViewAction {
        //? ...

        // Change the player's cannons

        if phi.events.now.key_1 == Some(true) {
            self.player.cannon = CannonType::RectBullet;
        }

        if phi.events.now.key_2 == Some(true) {
            self.player.cannon = CannonType::SineBullet {
                amplitude: 10.0,
                angular_vel: 15.0,
            };
        }

        if phi.events.now.key_3 == Some(true) {
            // TODO
        }

        //? ...
    }
}
```

Here's what it looks like:

![Divergent bullets](/images/arcade-17.png)

Finally, let's explore bullets that _do not_ go in a straight line, but instead
tend to drift to the top or the bottom of the screen. We would also like our
bullets to diverge, so that they have different trajectories. They could be
used, for instance, to attack enemies that cannot be reached from a direct shot.
Let's call those _divergent bullets_ (even though _tactical bullets_ would work,
too).

While `SineBullets` follow a sinusoidal trajectory, these bullets will follow
one given by:

$$
a \left(
  \left(x \over b\right)^3 - \left(x \over b\right)^2
\right)
$$

Which [you can plot with Google](https://www.google.ca/search?q=100+*+((x+%2F+36)^3+-+(x+%2F+36)^2)).

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
enum CannonType {
    RectBullet,
    SineBullet { amplitude: f64, angular_vel: f64 },
    DivergentBullet { a: f64, b: f64 },
}

//? ...

/// Bullet which follows a vertical trajectory given by:
///     a * ((t / b)^3 - (t / b)^2)
struct DivergentBullet {
    pos_x: f64,
    origin_y: f64,
    a: f64, // Influences the bump's height
    b: f64, // Influences the bump's width
    total_time: f64,
}

impl Bullet for DivergentBullet {
    fn update(mut self: Box<Self>, phi: &mut Phi, dt: f64) -> Option<Box<Bullet>> {
        self.total_time += dt;
        self.pos_x += BULLET_SPEED * dt;

        // If the bullet has left the screen, then delete it.
        let (w, h) = phi.output_size();
        let rect = self.rect();

        if rect.x > w || rect.x < 0.0 ||
           rect.y > h || rect.y < 0.0 {
            None
        } else {
            Some(self)
        }
    }

    fn render(&self, phi: &mut Phi) {
        // We will render this kind of bullet in yellow.
        phi.renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(230, 230, 30));
        phi.renderer.fill_rect(self.rect().to_sdl().unwrap());
    }

    fn rect(&self) -> Rectangle {
        let dy = self.a *
                    ((self.total_time / self.b).powi(3) -
                     (self.total_time / self.b).powi(2));

        Rectangle {
            x: self.pos_x,
            y: self.origin_y + dy,
            w: BULLET_W,
            h: BULLET_H,
        }
    }
}

//? ...

impl Ship {
    fn spawn_bullets(&self) -> Vec<Box<Bullet>> {
        let cannons_x = self.rect.x + 30.0;
        let cannon1_y = self.rect.y + 6.0;
        let cannon2_y = self.rect.y + SHIP_H - 10.0;

        match self.cannon {
            //? ...

            CannonType::DivergentBullet { a, b } =>
                vec![
                    // If a,b > 0, eventually goes upwards
                    Box::new(DivergentBullet {

                ]
        }
    }
}

//? ...

impl View for ShipView {
    fn render(&mut self, phi: &mut Phi, elapsed: f64) -> ViewAction {
        //? ...

        // Change the player's cannons

        if phi.events.now.key_1 == Some(true) {
            self.player.cannon = CannonType::RectBullet;
        }

        if phi.events.now.key_2 == Some(true) {
            self.player.cannon = CannonType::SineBullet {
                amplitude: 10.0,
                angular_vel: 15.0,
            };
        }

        if phi.events.now.key_3 == Some(true) {
            self.player.cannon = CannonType::DivergentBullet {
                a: 100.0,
                b: 1.2,
            };
        }

        //? ...
    }
}
```

Here's what this final kind of bullets looks like:

![Sinusoidal bullets](/images/arcade-18.png)

I invite you to play with different combinations of those parameters and, more
importantly, I would like you to create your own kinds of bullets. Maybe invent
one whose velocity depends on the x-position of the ship when it was created.
Good luck.


## Conclusion

This was my longest article to date &mdash; and without a doubt the one I've
spent the longest time actively writing. I eventually had to cut out bits about
manually dispatching methods with enumerations (which might become their own
article).

Anyways, I hope that you enjoyed this! In the [next article](/arcaders/arcaders-1-12),
we will _finally_ get some combat, and explosions.

Until then, keep rustaceanotizationing!
