This is the sixth part of a series whose objective is to explore the Rust
programming language through the development of a simple, old-school shooter.
It is composed of 16 parts, excluding the [introduction](/arcaders/arcaders-1-0/):

1. [A simple window](/arcaders/arcaders-1-1/), where we install SDL2
2. [Event handling](/arcaders/arcaders-1-2/), where we discuss lifetimes
3. [More event handling](/arcaders/arcaders-1-3/), where we discuss macros
4. [Views](/arcaders/arcaders-1-4/), where we learn about boxes, pattern matching, trait objects, and dynamic dispatch
5. [Switching views](/arcaders/arcaders-1-5/), where we use boxes, pattern matching, trait objects, and dynamic dispatch
6. [A moving rectangle](/arcaders/arcaders-1-6/), where we draw _things_
7. [Sprites](/arcaders/arcaders-1-7/), where we create our player's ship
8. [Backgrounds](/arcaders/arcaders-1-8/), where we handle resizing, scale and translate through time
9. [Main menu](/arcaders/arcaders-1-9), where we play with textures and Rust's vectors
10. [Asteroid attack!](/arcaders/arcaders-1-10), where we render animated asteroids
11. [Shooting bullets](/arcaders/arcaders-1-11), where we explore iterators
12. [Brawl, at last!](/arcaders/arcaders-1-12), where we make objects interact and explode
13. [« Boom! »](#), where we play sound.
14. [Variety](#), where we create more enemies
15. [Difficulty](#), where we manage the difficulty level and the score
16. [High score & wrap-up](#), where we play with the file-system and enhance our main menu


So far, we've setup the foundations that we will use throughout the rest of this
tutorial. Now that this is out of the way, we can get to the _good stuff_. In
this article, we are going to add a new view showing a rectangle. Nothing new
there, except for the fact that _the player will be able to control it_.

Once this is done, we will explore collision detection and ensure that the
player's ship cannot leave the screen. Because we want to support multiple
screen sizes, we will also handle window resizing.

Without further ado, let's get to it!


## The ship

Before anything else, you can clear the content of `views/mod.rs`. We will fill
it with more _interesting_ things throughout the rest of this chapter. The final
result will have the following structure:

```rust
use ::phi::{Phi, View, ViewAction};
use ::sdl2::pixels::Color;
use ::sdl2::rect::Rect as SdlRect;

// Constants

// Data types

// View definition
```

We will start from the very bottom by declaring a new view, called `ShipView`:

```rust
pub struct ShipView;

impl ShipView {
    pub fn new(phi: &mut Phi) -> ShipView {
        ShipView
    }
}

impl View for ShipView {
    fn render(&mut self, phi: &mut Phi, elapsed: f64) -> ViewAction {
        if phi.events.now.quit || phi.events.now.key_escape == Some(true) {
            return ViewAction::Quit;
        }

        // View logic here

        phi.renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(0, 0, 0));
        phi.renderer.clear();

        // View rendering here

        ViewAction::None
    }
}
```

... which we immediately instantiate in `main.rs`:

```rust
::phi::spawn("ArcadeRS Shooter", |phi| {
    Box::new(::views::ShipView::new(phi))
});
```

Nothing very impressive until now. However, it is time to create the cornerstone
of this article: the `Ship` data type:

```rust
struct Ship {
    rect: Rectangle,
}
```

The `Rectangle` type will be used to represent the bounding box of every entity
in our game. It is defined as follows:

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq)]
pub struct Rectangle {
    pub x: f64,
    pub y: f64,
    pub w: f64,
    pub h: f64,
}
```

SDL has itself a concept of a rectangle: `::sdl2::rect::Rect`, which we will
rename to `SdlRect` in order to highlight the differences between the two types.
Firstly, our version uses real coordinates instead of integral ones. Secondly,
it will allow us to add a few utility methods, notably to detect collisions.
For now, we will add only one method to `Rectangle`, allowing to bridge the gap
between the two code bases and render our bounding boxes during development:

```rust
impl Rectangle {
    /// Generates an SDL-compatible Rect equivalent to `self`.
    /// Panics if it could not be created, for example if a
    /// coordinate of a corner overflows an `i32`.
    pub fn to_sdl(self) -> Option<SdlRect> {
        // Reject negative width and height
        assert!(self.w >= 0.0 && self.h >= 0.0);

        // SdlRect::new : `(i32, i32, u32, u32) -> Result<Option<SdlRect>>`
        SdlRect::new(self.x as i32, self.y as i32, self.w as u32, self.h as u32)
            .unwrap()
    }
}
```

If you compile this code, you shouldn't see much of a difference. This is due to
the fact that we have not yet added the ship to our view, nor rendered it. Let's
do that:

```rust
use ::phi::{Phi, View, ViewAction};
use ::sdl2::pixels::Color;
use ::sdl2::rect::Rect as SdlRect;


#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq)]
pub struct Rectangle {
    pub x: f64,
    pub y: f64,
    pub w: f64,
    pub h: f64,
}

impl Rectangle {
    /// Generates an SDL-compatible Rect equivalent to `self`.
    /// Panics if it could not be created, for example if a
    /// coordinate of a corner overflows an `i32`.
    pub fn to_sdl(self) -> Option<SdlRect> {
        // Reject negative width and height
        assert!(self.w >= 0.0 && self.h >= 0.0);

        // SdlRect::new : `(i32, i32, u32, u32) -> Result<Option<SdlRect>>`
        SdlRect::new(self.x as i32, self.y as i32, self.w as u32, self.h as u32)
            .unwrap()
    }
}


struct Ship {
    rect: Rectangle
}


pub struct ShipView {
    player: Ship,
}

impl ShipView {
    pub fn new(phi: &mut Phi) -> ShipView {
        ShipView {
            player: Ship {
                rect: Rectangle {
                    x: 64.0,
                    y: 64.0,
                    w: 32.0,
                    h: 32.0,
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

impl View for ShipView {
    fn render(&mut self, phi: &mut Phi, elapsed: f64) -> ViewAction {
        if phi.events.now.quit || phi.events.now.key_escape == Some(true) {
            return ViewAction::Quit;
        }

        // [TODO] Insert the moving logic here

        // Clear the screen
        phi.renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(0, 0, 0));
        phi.renderer.clear();

        // Render the scene
        phi.renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(200, 200, 50));
        phi.renderer.fill_rect(self.player.rect.to_sdl().unwrap());

        ViewAction::None
    }
}

```

There we go: this is our player's _ship_. Now, let's make it move!


## Movement

Wondered what the `elapsed` argument to `render` was all about? Well, the way we
defined it, it represents the amount of time that passed between the current
frame and the previous one, in seconds. Now, our objective is to have everything
moving at a constant speed, no matter the frame rate. This is where `elapsed`
comes into play!

Say you want the player's ship to translate by 180 pixels every second. Then,
you would define:

```rust
/// Pixels traveled by the player's ship every second, when it is moving.
const PLAYER_SPEED: f64 = 180.0;
```

Thus, when you want to compute the amount of pixels traveled by the ship, you
simply do:

```rust
let traveled = PLAYER_SPEED * elapsed;
```

Let's put this in practice. You can add the `PLAYER_SPEED` constant at the top
of the file. You will also want to handle the `key_left` and `key_right` events:

<!-- [ANCHOR] Here, we change the struct_events! syntax -->

```rust
struct_events! {
    keyboard: {
        key_escape: Escape,
        key_up: Up,
        key_down: Down,
        key_left: Left,
        key_right: Right,
        key_space: Space
    },
    else: {
        quit: Quit { .. }
    }
}
```

Now that `Events` knows about all four directional keys, we can move the ship:

```rust
// Move the player's ship

let diagonal =
    (phi.events.key_up ^ phi.events.key_down) &&
    (phi.events.key_left ^ phi.events.key_right);

let moved =
    if diagonal { 1.0 / 2.0f64.sqrt() }
    else { 1.0 } * PLAYER_SPEED * elapsed;

let dx = match (phi.events.key_left, phi.events.key_right) {
    (true, true) | (false, false) => 0.0,
    (true, false) => -moved,
    (false, true) => moved,
};

let dy = match (phi.events.key_up, phi.events.key_down) {
    (true, true) | (false, false) => 0.0,
    (true, false) => -moved,
    (false, true) => moved,
};

self.player.rect.x += dx;
self.player.rect.y += dy;
```

The code compiles, and it's a good sign: it means that our patterns are
_exhaustive_; that is, the compiler ensured that we covered all possible cases.

On the third line, we are using the `^` (XOR, exclusive OR) symbol. It means:
"if and only if either of my arguments is `true`, but not both, then evaluate to
`true`". Its truth table is the following:

| A | B | A ^ B |
|:-:|:-:|:-----:|
| T | T |   F   |
| T | F |   T   |
| F | T |   T   |
| F | F |   F   |

In this context, it means: if we press either up or down, but not both at the
same time (which would make their effects cancel), then we are moving along this
axis. If we are moving along both axes, then the movement is diagonal. From
basic trigonometry, we know that

$$\sin(45°) = \cos(45°) = {\sqrt 2 \over 2} = {1 \over \sqrt 2}$$

Thus, when moving diagonally, the distance traveled in any direction is equal to

$${v \Delta t} \over \sqrt 2$$


## Bounding boxes

The next step is to prevent the player's ship from leaving the screen. To do so,
we will add a new method to the `Rectangle` type:

```rust
impl Rectangle {
    // ...

    /// Return a (perhaps moved) rectangle which is contained by a `parent`
    /// rectangle. If it can indeed be moved to fit, return `Some(result)`;
    /// otherwise, return `None`.
    pub fn move_inside(self, parent: Rectangle) -> Option<Rectangle> {
        // It must be smaller than the parent rectangle to fit in it.
        if self.w > parent.w || self.h > parent.h {
            return None;
        }

        Some(Rectangle {
            w: self.w,
            h: self.h,
            x: if self.x < parent.x { parent.x }
               else if self.x + self.w >= parent.x + parent.w { parent.x + parent.w - self.w }
               else { self.x },
            y: if self.y < parent.y { parent.y }
               else if self.y + self.h >= parent.y + parent.h { parent.y + parent.h - self.h }
               else { self.y },
        })
    }
}
```

Equipped with this new method, we can now stuff back the player in the screen at
the end of the moving logic:

```rust
// If the player cannot fit in the screen, then there is a problem and
// the game should be promptly aborted.
self.player.rect = self.player.rect.move_inside(movable_region).unwrap();
```

Now, we just have to figure out what this _movable region_ is. For that, we will
have to handle window resizing. Because this is so fundamental, we will go back
to our `phi/events.rs` file and modify our macro.

First, we add the `resize: Option<(u32, u32)>` attribute to `ImmediateEvents`
and to `ImmediateEvents::new`, where it is set to `None`. Then, we change
`Events::pump`'s signature to:

```rust
pub fn pump(&mut self, renderer: &mut ::sdl2::render::Renderer);
```

We can now change the top of `Events::pump`'s `for` loop to:

<!-- [ANCHOR] resized event handling -->

```rust
use ::sdl2::event::Event::*;
use ::sdl2::event::WindowEventId::Resized;
use ::sdl2::keyboard::Keycode::*;

match event {
    Window { win_event_id: Resized, .. } => {
        self.now.resize = Some(renderer.output_size().unwrap());
    },

    // ... previous event recording logic ...
}
```

It turns out that `renderer` provides a `output_size` method, which returns
a `Result<(u32, u32)>`. If it cannot get the window's size, then it probably
means that the it has been closed, which cannot happen, because SDL only
pushes events while the game is alive.

Now in `phi/mod.rs`, we slightly modify the `spawn` function to...

* Make the window resizable:

```rust
let window = video.window(title, 800, 600)
    .position_centered().opengl().resizable()
    .build().unwrap();
```

* Pass the renderer to `Events::pump`:

```rust
context.events.pump(&mut context.renderer);
```

Knowing that we will always be able to get the window's size as long as Phi
lives, we will also add a method to `Phi`. However, we will cast the dimensions
to floating-point numbers, so that they play well with our `Rectangle` struct,
whose attributes are also floating-point numbers.

```rust
impl<'window> Phi<'window> {
    pub fn output_size(&self) -> (f64, f64) {
        let (w, h) = self.renderer.output_size().unwrap();
        (w as f64, h as f64)
    }
}
```

Now, back in `views/mod.rs`, we can finally compute `movable_region`. I added it
directly over the call to `move_inside`.

```rust
// The movable region spans the entire height of the window and 70% of its
// width. This way, the player cannot get to the far right of the screen, where
// we will spawn the asteroids, and get immediately eliminated.
//
// We restrain the width because most screens are wider than they are high.
let movable_region = Rectangle {
    x: 0.0,
    y: 0.0,
    w: phi.output_size().0 * 0.70,
    h: phi.output_size().1,
};

// If the player cannot fit in the screen, then there is a problem and
// the game should be promptly aborted.
self.player.rect = self.player.rect.move_inside(movable_region).unwrap();
```

If you compile the code, you should now get a controllable, yellowy rectangle
which can neither leave the frame nor go to its far right.

You should also notice that we can also resize the window, as long as we do not
get it smaller than the player's ship.

## A library concern

Remember that Phi is all about putting our reusable components in one place, and
what would better fit this description than `Rectangle`? Because it doesn't feel
like it should have its place at the root of the library, yet isn't an event, it
is time to create a new file: `src/phi/data.rs`:

```rust
// src/phi/mod.rs
// There's a new module in town: data

#[macro_use]
mod events;
pub mod data;

// ...
```

```rust
// src/phi/data.rs

use ::sdl2::rect::Rect as SdlRect;

#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq)]
pub struct Rectangle {
    pub x: f64,
    pub y: f64,
    pub w: f64,
    pub h: f64,
}

impl Rectangle {
    /// Generates an SDL-compatible Rect equivalent to `self`.
    /// Panics if it could not be created, for example if a
    /// coordinate of a corner overflows an `i32`.
    pub fn to_sdl(self) -> Option<SdlRect> {
        // Reject negative width and height
        assert!(self.w >= 0.0 && self.h >= 0.0);

        // SdlRect::new : `(i32, i32, u32, u32) -> Result<Option<SdlRect>>`
        SdlRect::new(self.x as i32, self.y as i32, self.w as u32, self.h as u32)
            .unwrap()
    }

    /// Returns a (perhaps moved) rectangle which is contained by a `parent`
    /// rectangle. If it can indeed be moved to fit, return `Some(result)`;
    /// otherwise, return `None`.
    pub fn move_inside(self, parent: Rectangle) -> Option<Rectangle> {
        // It must be smaller than the parent rectangle to fit in it.
        if self.w > parent.w || self.h > parent.h {
            return None;
        }

        Some(Rectangle {
            w: self.w,
            h: self.h,
            x: if self.x < parent.x { parent.x }
               else if self.x + self.w >= parent.x + parent.w { parent.x + parent.w - self.w }
               else { self.x },
            y: if self.y < parent.y { parent.y }
               else if self.y + self.h >= parent.y + parent.h { parent.y + parent.h - self.h }
               else { self.y },
        })
    }
}
```

```rust
// src/views/mod.rs
// Just take out the definition for `Rectangle` and `use` it instead.

use ::phi::{Phi, View, ViewAction};
use ::phi::data::Rectangle;
use ::sdl2::pixels::Color;

// ...
```

In this file, we will store our general data structures, including `Rectangle`,
of course, but also other niceties such as resource pools. However, this is a
story for another time...


## Utility methods

We will also implement the following utility methods, which we will use to
implement sprite regions and collision detection. I let you figure out how
they work.

```rust
impl Rectangle {
    // ...

    pub fn contains(&self, rect: Rectangle) -> bool {
        let xmin = rect.x;
        let xmax = xmin + rect.w as i32;
        let ymin = rect.y;
        let ymax = ymin + rect.h as i32;

        xmin >= self.x && xmin <= self.x + self.w as i32 &&
        xmax >= self.x && xmax <= self.x + self.w as i32 &&
        ymin >= self.y && ymin <= self.y + self.h as i32 &&
        ymax >= self.y && ymax <= self.y + self.h as i32
    }

    pub fn overlaps(&self, other: Rectangle) -> bool {
        self.x < other.x + other.w as i32 &&
        self.x + self.w as i32 > other.x &&
        self.y < other.y + other.h as i32 &&
        self.y + self.h as i32 > other.y
    }
}
```


## Conclusion

Well, this is what I would call a productive chapter! We jumped from a window
of a single color to a constrained, movable rectangle. It may not seem like it,
but our game is starting to take shape, and soon enough we will have a working
prototype.

In the [next article](/arcaders/arcaders-1-7), we will learn how to manage and
render images, or _sprites_.

And until then, keep rusting!
