categories: arcaders
---

This is the first part of a series whose objective is to explore the Rust
programming language through the development of a simple, old-school shooter.
It is composed of 16 parts, excluding the [introduction](/arcaders/arcaders-1-0):

  1. [A simple window](/arcaders/arcaders-1-1/), where we install SDL2
  2. [Event handling](/arcaders/arcaders-1-2/), where we discuss lifetimes
  3. [More event handling](/arcaders/arcaders-1-3/), where we discuss macros
  4. [Views](/arcaders/arcaders-1-4/), where we learn about boxes, pattern matching, trait objects, and dynamic dispatch
  5. [Switching views](/arcaders/arcaders-1-5/), where we use boxes, pattern matching, trait objects, and dynamic dispatch
  6. [A moving rectangle](/arcaders/arcaders-1-6/), where we draw _things_
  7. [Sprites](/arcaders/arcaders-1-7/), where we create shareable images
  8. [Backgrounds](#), where we handle resizing, scale and translate through time
  9. [Main menu](#), where we play with textures and Rust's vectors
  10. [The player's ship](#), where we control a multi-sprite object
  11. [Shooting bullets](#), where we handle resource pooling
  12. [Animated sprites](#), where we render animated asteroids
  13. [Asteroid attack!](#), where we make multiple objects interact
  14. [Explosions](#), where we see things do _boom_.
  15. [Music](#), where we hear things go _boom_.
  16. [High score & wrap-up](#), where we play with the filesystem


## A brave new project

Let us begin by kindly asking Cargo to create a new project for us. In your
projects directory, run:

    $ cargo new arcade-rs --bin
    $ cd arcade-rs

If you open the generated `Cargo.toml`, you should see something similar to the
following:

    [package]
    name = "arcade-rs"
    version = "0.1.0"
    authors = ["John Doe <john.doe@example.com>"]

You can `cargo run` the generated hello world program, but this is of little
value to us right now. What we _will_ do, however, is change slightly this
configuration file in order to include some dependencies. You should add the
following lines at the end of the file:

    [dependencies]
    sdl2 = "0.9"

Towards the end, our project will depend on _way_ more external _crates_
(Rust's concept of a library), but this is all we need for the moment. The
`sdl2` crate will allow us to create a window, render to it, and handle
events... and it so happens that this is exactly what we are going to do in
the next few articles.

> It is possible that SDL2's development libraries are not yet installed on your

> In order to install the development libraries on your system, I'd recommend to

> Once you're done, we can go forward.

Now that SDL2 is (hopefully) correctly installed on your system, you can execute:

```
$ cargo build
    Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`

```

   Compiling arcade-rs v0.1.0 (file:///home/johndoe/projects/arcade-rs)
-->

If all goes well, the bindings and their dependencies have been compiled and we
are ready to open a window. Otherwise, SDL2 was probably incorrectly installed
and you need to get that out of the way before moving on.


## Three seconds of awesome

Alright, let there be a window! Open `src/main.rs` in your favourite editor and
change the content for this one:

```rust
extern crate sdl2;

use sdl2::pixels::Color;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    // Initialize SDL2
    let sdl_context = sdl2::init().unwrap();
    let video = sdl_context.video().unwrap();

    // Create the window
    let window = video.window("ArcadeRS Shooter", 800, 600)
        .position_centered().opengl()
        .build().unwrap();

    let mut renderer = window.renderer()
        .accelerated()
        .build().unwrap();

    // Render a fully black window
    renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(0, 0, 0));
    renderer.clear();
    renderer.present();

    thread::sleep_ms(3000);
}
```

Now, when you run the program...

```
$ cargo run
   Compiling arcade-rs v0.1.0 (file:///home/johndoe/projects/arcade-rs)
     Running `target/debug/arcade-rs`
```

![Our first window](/images/arcade-1.png)

... you should see a window appearing on your screen for 3 seconds, then
automatically disappearing. And that was it! Now for the fun part: actually
understanding what we just wrote.


## Setting things up

```rust
extern crate sdl2;
```

We begin by including the `sdl2` _crate_ that we just added to our dependencies.
If we wanted, we could have given it another name _à-la python_. For example:

```rust
extern crate sdl2 as pineapple;
```

We would then replace every occurence of `sdl2` by `pineapple` and the result
would be the same. However, as much as I like pineapples, I'll continue with
`sdl2` for the rest of this series (although nothing stops _you_ from doing
otherwise). A similar syntax can be used for renaming `use`d types and
functions: this one I _will_ use in the [sixth article](/arcaders/arcaders-1-6).

```rust
use sdl2::pixels::Color;
use std::thread;
```

The first line simply means: `sdl2::pixels::Color` is way too long for me to
type, so let me `use` only the last identifier of this path instead, that is
`Color`, to represent the same _thing_. Not only do `use` statements work with
types and functions, they also work with modules. This is, in fact, the job of
the second line: instead of writing `std::thread::whatever()`, we may now write
`thread::whatever()`.

```rust
fn main() {

}
```

Here, we simply declare the `main` function, which is acting as the entry point
for our program.


## Error handling

```rust
let sdl_context = sdl2::init().unwrap();
let video = sdl_context.video().unwrap();
```

Now, it starts to get interesting! By default, SDL2 doesn't provide any
functionality; this forces us to use only what we need and thus decreases our
game's memory footprint. `sdl2::init()` introduces the very core of the library,
while more specific components, such as `video`, `timer` and `joystick`, must be
requested individually.

Each time, requesting a functionality returns a `Result<Handler, String>`, where
`Handler` is the type of the component we wish to use. Unlike most languages,
Rust uses _types_, instead of exceptions, to ensure that errors are propagated.
This is what you will typically find in a typed functional language such as
[Elm](http://elm-lang.org/). It makes error handling generally more efficient
and easier to reason about.

Because errors are part of the type-system, whenever we want to get the result
of an operation that might fail, we are _forced_ to deal with this possibility.
Specifically, the [`Result`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/result/enum.Result.html)
type is defined as follows:

```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
```

The `enum` keyword introduces a _variadic type_ or, if you're not coming from a
functional background, an _enumeration_. It basically says: a value of type
`Result` can either be `Ok` (the function succeeded) or `Err` (it failed).

The `<...>` (type parameters) introduce a _generic_. This is akin to a pattern
that we let the compiler fill in, where `T` and `E` are placeholders.
For example, the `sdl2::init` function has the following signature:

```rust
pub fn init() -> Result<Sdl, String>;
```

You might then guess what comes next: when it sees this function, the compiler
creates a new type called `Result<Sdl, String>`. It is defined as such:

```rust
// The following snippet doesn't actually work, because you cannot use type
// parameters when you don't need them, but you should get the point.

enum Result<Sdl, String> {
    Ok(Sdl),
    Err(String),
}
```

If we want to get the SDL context, we must check that it is `Ok`. To do so, we
use the `match` operator:

```rust
let sdl_context = match sdl2::init() {
    Ok(ctx) => ctx,
    Err(error_message) => ???
};
```

Now, what should we do if indeed there was an error and we cannot load the
library? In this case, there is no point going further, so we crash, we _panic_:

```rust
let sdl_context = match sdl2::init() {
    Ok(ctx) => ctx,
    Err(error_message) => panic!(error_message),
};
```

It turns out that this pattern is so common, there is a method in the standard
library to do exactly that: `Result::unwrap`.

```rust
let sdl_context = sdl2::init().unwrap();
```

_Unwrapping_ an `Err` value prints the error message and causes a _panic_,
_safely crashing_ the program. If the unwrapped value is of type `Ok(Sdl)`, the
wrapped value is simply returned and assigned to `sdl_context`.

The nice thing about binding the context to an identifier is that, once it goes
out of scope (at the end of the main method), all of the resources owned by the
SDL library will be automatically freed. In fact, even if we panic at some
point in the program, the destructor will still be called as usual, preventing
memory leaks. This is what I mean by _safely crashing_.


## Rendering

```rust
let window = video.window("ArcadeRS Shooter", 800, 600)
    .position_centered().opengl()
    .build().unwrap();
```

This is where we open the window. It has a title of "ArcadeRS Shooter", a width
of 800 pixels, and a height of 600 pixels. It uses the _builder pattern_: every
method until `build` (that is, `window`, `position_centered`, `opengl`) lazily
shapes a description of the window, which `build` will use to _build_ the window
that we will show to our users. In this case, we center the window and activate
OpenGL (faster) rendering.

The resulting window is unwrapped such that, if it could not be created, the
program will panic with an error message.

```rust
let mut renderer = window.renderer()
    .accelerated()
    .build().unwrap();
```

You know the drill! We are creating a renderer, which we will later use to
_draw things_, associated with the window and setting it up so that it uses
OpenGL to ease the rendering process. If it cannot be created, the program
panics with an error message.

```rust
renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(0, 0, 0));
renderer.clear();
renderer.present();
```

On the first line, we set the _brush_ color to black (red=0, green=0, blue=0).
On the second one, we clear the content of the buffer and fill it with the
previously chosen _brush_ color.

The third line swaps the buffers and actually _shows_ what we have drawn to the
user. If we take this line off, weirdness happen. In Gnome, for example, the
content of the window is set to whatever was previously behind it. However, as
is tradition in the Rust world, although it may _look weird_, the `renderer`
provides an interface from which we cannot accidentally crash the program.

![A window not `present`ed](/images/arcade-2.png)

```rust
thread::sleep_ms(3000);
```

Here, we simply _wait_ 3000 milliseconds, or 3 seconds, before moving on. And
it turns out that afterwards, `main` finishes and all the resources that were
allocated inside it are freed. To our user, it simply results in the window
closing. To us, it's not very different. And if a lot is happening here, the
nice thing is that we do not have to worry about it!

What you might have noticed is that we never had to write down a single type.
Sure, we used module functions and associated functions (which you might know
better under the name _static methods_), such as `sdl2::init` and `Color::new`,
but we never had to tell Rust that our context was of type `sdl2::Sdl`. This is
called _type inference_ and it's one of these numerous features that, although
they seem like minor additions, make Rust a pleasure to work with.

That was all for the first part of this series. [Next time](/arcaders/arcaders-1-2),
we will come up with a better way to close our window: by clicking on the `x`.

Until then, keep rusting!
