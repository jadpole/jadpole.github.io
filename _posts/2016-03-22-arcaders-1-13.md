In the previous article, we finally allowed our player to fight its foes: a
swarm of randomly created asteroids. Not the most epic of battles, but at least
our program works! In this article, we will start polishing our game by adding
audio to it. Asteroids will go "boom!", bullets will go "pew", and we will add
some [epic music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x49T4Vyb7m0) so our game at
least _sounds_ intense.

Then, we'll make our API more _functional_ and learn what the compiler _cannot_
do (because, y'know, it can't always be all rainbows and unicorns! For now at
least. Don't worry, well nail that one day... hopefully... eh, let's just start
already...)


## The last dependency

For the task at hand, we will need yet another library; yet another plugin for
SDL2. This time, we will use andelf's
[rust-sdl2_mixer](https://github.com/andelf/rust-sdl2_mixer). Notice that he's
also the person that maintains the Rust bindings for SDL2_image, so you should
expect some similarities.

First, let's add this library to our `Cargo.toml` dependencies:

```
[dependencies]
rand = "0.3"
sdl2 = "0.24"
sdl2_image = "0.24"
sdl2_mixer = "0.24"
sdl2_ttf = "0.24"
```

Then, let's import it in `main.rs`:

```rust
extern crate sdl2_mixer;
```

You may have to install the developer packages for SDL2\_mixer. Because the
process varies drastically from one platform to the next, I'll let you figure
that part out.

As you have probably guessed by now, the next step is to create a handler that
will initialize and clean up behind the plugin in `phi/mod.rs`. We will
configure our audio channel at the same time.

```rust
pub fn spawn<F>(title: &str, init: F)
where F: Fn(&mut Phi) -> Box<View> {
    //? Initialize SDL2
    //? ...

    // Initialize audio plugin
    //? We will stick to the Ogg format throughout this article. However, you
    //? can easily require other ones.
    let _mixer_context = ::sdl2_mixer::init(::sdl2_mixer::INIT_OGG).unwrap();
    //? We configure our audio context so that:
    //?   * The frequency is 44100;
    //?   * Use signed 16 bits samples, in little-endian byte order;
    //?   * It's also stereo (2 "channels");
    //?   * Samples are 1024 bytes in size.
    //? You don't really need to understand what all of this means. I myself just
    //? copy-pasted this from andelf's demo. ;-)
    ::sdl2_mixer::open_audio(44100, ::sdl2_mixer::AUDIO_S16LSB, 2, 1024).unwrap();
    //? This function asks us how many channels we wish to allocate for our game.
    //? That is, how many sounds do we wish to be able to play at the same time?
    //? While testing, 16 channels seemed to be sufficient. Which means that we
    //? should probably request 32 of 'em just in case. :-°
    ::sdl2_mixer::allocate_channels(32);

    //? ...
}
```

Now that this is out of the way, we can add some music to our game!


## Epic music

The song that we will play throughout our game will be the orchestral remix of
_Phoenix_ by [MDK](http://www.morgandavidking.com/), whose work I
<span title="No, seriously, you should take a few minute and listen to that stuff, it's really good.">particularly enjoy</span>.

<audio controls>
  <source src="/assets/mdk_phoenix_orchestral.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
  Your browser does not support the audio element. Get the file
  <a href="/assets/mdk_phoenix_orchestral.ogg">here</a>.
</audio>

You should save it as `assets/mdk_phoenix_orchestral.ogg`.

Let's see how this library works, then we'll use it in our `GameView`.

SDL2\_mixer allows us to load music with the `Music::new` associated function. It
returns a `Result<Music, String>`. Because we can be pretty confident that
whatever file we wish to access exists &mdash; otherwise, we would like a quick
crash to inform us that we were wrong &mdash; we can simply unwrap the result:

```rust
use sdl2_mixer::Music;

//? ...

//? If the file cannot be loaded, then the error message will be:
//?
//>   thread '<main>' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value:
//>   ErrorMessage("Couldn\'t open assets/mdk_phoenix_orchestral.ogg")', ../src/libcore/result.rs:741
//>   Process didn't exit successfully: `target/debug/arcade-rs` (exit code: 101)
//?
//? It isn't optimal, but it should be good enough for our purpose.
let music =
    Music::from_file(Path::new("assets/mdk_phoenix_orchestral.ogg"))
    .unwrap();
```

As you may be able to guess, we can play `music` using the `play` method. This
method expects an integer indicating _how many times_ it should be _repeated_.
That is, it will be played once more than whatever number was passed to it.
Moreover, `play` doesn't expect to receive a `usize`, but an `isize`. That is,
we can send it a negative amount of repetitions. This allows us to loop over the
same music "infinitely".

```rust
impl Music {
    /// Attempt to play the music `loops + 1` times. If the provided integer is
    /// negative, then play the song as many times as possible until `self`
    /// is dropped.
    pub fn play(&self, loops: isize) -> SdlResult<()>;
    //? ...
}
```

For the sake of brevity, we won't do anything _incredible_ with sound, like
start some specific music as we approach the boss' lair &mdash; although Rust
makes this particularly easy. We will keep it simple and loop over the same song
for the duration of the game. This means that we will call:

```rust
// Play the song over and over again until `music` is dropped.
music.play(-1).unwrap();
```

What is interesting with andelf's bindings of SDL2\_mixer is that, whenever a
`Music` object is dropped, it stops playing. This makes switching between musics
incredibly easy:

```rust
//? The previous value of `current_music` is dropped: the music is stopped.
current_music = new_music;
//? Mere instants afterwards, the next instruction executes and the new song
//? starts playing. There will not be any noticeable "moment of silence".
current_music.play(-1).unwrap();
```

This stops the currently playing music and starts looping over some other song
instead. It also means that we can continue playing the same song throughout
many views without having to restart or pause it! This is possible and safe
because of Rust's affine type-system. Indeed, while the same behaviour would be
complicated to implement in say, Java or C++, it is trivial to do in Rust: you
just move a value, and stop the music in `Drop`.

Alright, let's get back to what we are trying to achieve: play some music
in `GameView`!

```rust
use sdl2_mixer::Music;
use std::path::Path;

//? ...

pub struct GameView {
    //? ...
    music: Music,
}

impl GameView {
    pub fn with_backgrounds(phi: &mut Phi, bg: BgSet) -> GameView {
        let music =
            Music::from_file(Path::new("assets/mdk_phoenix_orchestral.ogg"))
            .unwrap();

        music.play(-1).unwrap();

        GameView {
            //? ...

            // Audio
            music: music,
        }
    }
}
```

That's it! With those six extra lines, music should play whenever you start a
new game and stop whenever you press escape and return to the main menu &mdash;
because then, `GameView` is dropped, and so are all of its attributes, including
`music`.


## Of bullets and explosions

While `Music` is used to represent longer sounds, which are __TODO__ read from
the file as they are needed, SDL2\_mixer uses `Chunk` to describe shorter sounds
that are played often. This is the type that we will use to store the audio
played when firing bullets and blowing up asteroids.

Here's the chunk that we will use to fire bullets, by Omar Alvarado:

<audio controls>
  <source src="/assets/bullet.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
  Your browser does not support the audio element. Get the file
  <a href="/assets/bullet.ogg">here</a>.
</audio>

And here's another one, which we will use to make stuff explode:

<audio controls>
  <source src="/assets/explosion.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
  Your browser does not support the audio element. Get the file
  <a href="/assets/explosion.ogg">here</a>.
</audio>

<!--

        In the public domain.
I slightly modified (trimmed) both of them.
-->

Let's load and store those from within our game:

```rust
use sdl2_mixer::{Chunk, Music};

//? ...

pub struct GameView {
    //? ...

    music: Music,
    bullet_sound: Chunk,
    explosion_sound: Chunk,
}

impl GameView {
    pub fn with_backgrounds(phi: &mut Phi, bg: BgSet) -> GameView {
        let music =
            Music::from_file(Path::new("assets/mdk_phoenix_orchestral.ogg"))
            .unwrap();

        music.play(-1).unwrap();

        let bullet_sound =
            Chunk::from_file(Path::new("assets/bullet.ogg"))
            .unwrap();

        let explosion_sound =
            Chunk::from_file(Path::new("assets/explosion.ogg"))
            .unwrap();

        GameView {
            //? ...

            // Sound
            music: music,
            bullet_sound: bullet_sound,
            explosion_sound: explosion_sound,
        }
    }
}
```

You should verify that this code compiles and runs properly &mdash; that is,
that you have correctly downloaded and referred to the chunks.

If that worked, it is time to play some sound! For this, we will use the
`Channel` type, which allows us to play one chunk at a time. Then, the library
will automatically go through every channel that it allocated and mix them
together. The result will be sent to your hardware and transformed to those
vibrations that we call "sound".

A nice feature of SDL2\_mixer, and many other similar libraries, is that we do
not actually have to deal with channels, at least not manually. By using
`Channel::all()`, we ask SDL2\_mixer to find _some available channel_, we do not
care which. Then, we tell this channel which chunk to play, how many times to
repeat it, and everything should work properly, yay!

More specifically, to play a sound once, we write this:

```rust
::sdl2_mixer::Channel::all().play(&my_chunk, 0);
```

The `play` method returns a `Result`. If there indeed _was_ an available
channel, it returns `Ok`. If there wasn't, then it returns `Err`. The question
now is: how should we handle an error? Crashing the program would be slightly
drastic, and some missing sounds here and there probably won't ruin the
experience. Yet, if not enough channels were available, it would be nice to fix
this and allocate some more.

Here's my solution to this issue: first, we remove the call to
`allocate_channels` from `phi::spawn`; then, we update `Phi` so that it takes
care of allocating enough channels automatically.

```rust
/// Bundles the Phi abstractions in a single structure which
/// can be passed easily between functions.
pub struct Phi<'window> {
    pub events: Events,
    pub renderer: Renderer<'window>,

    allocated_channels: isize,
    ttf_context: Sdl2TtfContext,
    cached_fonts: HashMap<(&'static str, i32), ::sdl2_ttf::Font>,
}

impl<'window> Phi<'window> {
    fn new(events: Events, renderer: Renderer<'window>) -> Phi<'window> {
        // We start with 32 mixer channels, which we may grow if necessary.
        let allocated_channels = 32;
        ::sdl2_mixer::allocate_channels(allocated_channels);

        Phi {
            events: events,
            renderer: renderer,
            allocated_channels: allocated_channels,
            ttf_context: ::sdl2_ttf::init().unwrap(),
            cached_fonts: HashMap::new(),
        }
    }

    //? ...

    /// Play a sound once, and allocate new channels if this is necessary.
    pub fn play_sound(&mut self, sound: &::sdl2_mixer::Chunk) {
        // Attempt to play the sound once.
        match ::sdl2_mixer::Channel::all().play(sound, 0) {
            Err(_) => {
                // If there weren't enough channels allocated, then we double
                // that number and try again.
                self.allocated_channels *= 2;
                ::sdl2_mixer::allocate_channels(self.allocated_channels);
                self.play_sound(sound);
            },

            _ => { /* Everything's Alright! */ }
        }
    }
}
```

This should work just fine! We should now be able to play this sound inside of
our game's logic. In `views/game.rs`, add the following:

```rust
impl View for GameView {
    fn render(&mut self, phi: &mut Phi, elapsed: f64) -> ViewAction {
        //? ...

        self.asteroids =
            ::std::mem::replace(&mut self.asteroids, vec![])
            .into_iter()
            .filter_map(|asteroid| {
                //? ...

                if asteroid_alive {
                    Some(asteroid)
                } else {
                    // Spawn an explosive wherever an asteroid was destroyed.
                    self.explosions.push(
                        self.explosion_factory.at_center(
                            asteroid.rect().center()));

                    phi.play_sound(&self.explosion_sound);

                    None
                }
            })
            .collect();

        //? ...

        if phi.events.now.key_space == Some(true) {
            self.bullets.append(&mut self.player.spawn_bullets());
            phi.play_sound(&self.bullet_sound);
        }

        //? ...
    }
}
```

It isn't any more complicated than that. If you followed along, you should now be
able to play your game as you did before, except that now, there's audio stuff!


## Moar functional programming!

In the next article, I would like to store the current state of the game in
`MainMenuView` so that we can pause without losing our progress, keep rendering
our game (without updating it) and continue to play the song with a smaller gain.

However, as of right now, this is simply impossible with the way that we
designed our library! Consider this obvious, but bad, solution:

```rust
impl View for GameView {
    fn render(&mut self, phi: &mut Phi, elapsed: f64) -> ViewAction {
        //? ...

        if phi.events.now.key_escape == Some(true) {
            return ViewAction::ChangeView(Box::new(
                ::views::main_menu::MainMenuView::with_game_state(self)));
        }

        //? ...
    }
}
```

This will not compile, and for a very simple reason: we do not actually _own_
our view when writing the body of `render`. What we have instead is a
_mutable reference_ to our view, that is, we promised the phi engine that we
would give it back its view, and the compiler's gonna make sure that we
collaborate.

Notice that we could use a more functional approach and write something like
this instead:

```rust
pub trait View {
    fn render(self: Box<Self>, context: &mut Phi, elapsed: f64) -> ViewAction;
}

pub enum ViewAction {
    Render(Box<View>),
    Quit,
}

impl View for GameView {
    fn render(mut self: Box<Self>, phi: &mut Phi, elapsed: f64) -> ViewAction {
        if phi.events.now.quit {
            //? Notice that `self` is not passed to `Quit`, therefore it will go
            //? out of scope as the function returns. This means that our view
            //? will be dropped just before the method returns.
            return ViewAction::Quit;
        }

        if phi.events.now.key_escape == Some(true) {
            // Render a new view instead
            return ViewAction::Render(Box::new(
                ::views::main_menu::MainMenuView::with_game_state(self)));
        }

        ViewAction::render(self)
    }
}
```

This is clean, nice, it's even efficient! Indeed, because our data structure is
stored in a `Box`, it is allocated on the _heap_ and thus the only thing that we
are passing around is a fat pointer &mdash; on my machine, it only takes 16 bytes.

Also, because we want our view to keep rendering while our game is paused, we
must separate our `render` method in two: `update` and `render`. At the end of
the day, our `Phi` changes a bit, but not that much.

```rust
//? ...

/// A `ViewAction` is a way for the currently executed view to communicate with
/// the game loop. It specifies whether an action should be executed before the
/// next rendering.
pub enum ViewAction {
    Render(Box<View>),
    Quit,
}


/// Interface through which Phi interacts with the possible states in which the
/// application can be.
pub trait View {
    /// Called on every frame to take care of the logic of the program. From
    /// user inputs and the instance's internal state, determine whether to
    /// render itself or another view, close the window, etc.
    ///
    /// `elapsed` is expressed in seconds.
    fn update(self: Box<Self>, context: &mut Phi, elapsed: f64) -> ViewAction;

    /// Called on every frame to take care rendering the current view. It
    /// disallows mutating the object by default, although you may still do it
    /// through a `RefCell` if you need to.
    fn render(&self, context: &mut Phi);
}

//? ...

pub fn spawn<F>(title: &str, init: F)
where F: Fn(&mut Phi) -> Box<View> {
    //? Initialization stuff...

    loop {
        //? Frame timing...

        // Logic & rendering

        context.events.pump(&mut context.renderer);

        match current_view.update(&mut context, elapsed) {
            ViewAction::Render(view) => {
                current_view = view;
                current_view.render(&mut context);
                context.renderer.present();
            },

            ViewAction::Quit =>
                break,
        }
    }
}
```

Before we go further, you might notice that most of the code that we have
written the the `view` module is now broken. This is fine, we'll fix it later,
but it would be nice to check whether our library stays consistent as we make
changes to it, so we'll change `main.rs` to:

```rust
extern crate rand;
extern crate sdl2;
extern crate sdl2_image;
extern crate sdl2_mixer;
extern crate sdl2_ttf;

mod phi;
// mod views;

use sdl2::pixels::Color;

struct MyView;
impl ::phi::View for MyView {
    fn update(self: Box<Self>, phi: &mut ::phi::Phi, elapsed: f64) -> ::phi::ViewAction {
        if phi.events.now.quit || phi.events.key_escape {
            return ::phi::ViewAction::Quit;
        }

        ::phi::ViewAction::Render(self)
    }

    fn render(&self, phi: &mut ::phi::Phi) {
        phi.renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(0, 0, 0));
        phi.renderer.clear();
    }
}


fn main() {
    ::phi::spawn("ArcadeRS Shooter", |phi| {
        Box::new(MyView)
    });
}
```

It's dirty, but it's quick to implement and it works. Your code should now
compile properly and give you a black screen. If that's not the case, you've
probably made an error somewhere. It works? Then let's push forward!


## Functional in practice

Before we finally get to our `GameView`, let's update some abstractions of ours
to make them more _functional_. You might have noticed that `View::render` takes
an immutable reference to `self`, meaning that we cannot update the backgrounds
inside of the `render` method. We must also split it into `update` and `render`.

To do this, open `views/shared.rs` and update the relevant lines to:

```rust
impl Background {
    /// Move the background proportionally to the elapsed time since the last
    /// frame and the background's velocity.
    pub fn update(&mut self, elapsed: f64) {
        // We define a logical position as depending solely on the time and the
        // dimensions of the image, not on the screen's size.
        let size = self.sprite.size();
        self.pos += self.vel * elapsed;
        if self.pos > size.0 {
            self.pos -= size.0;
        }
    }

    /// Render the background at its current position, and as many times as
    /// required to fill the screen.
    pub fn render(&self, renderer: &mut Renderer) {
        // We determine the scale ratio of the window to the sprite.
        let size = self.sprite.size();
        let (win_w, win_h) = renderer.output_size().unwrap();
        let scale = win_h as f64 / size.1;

        // We render as many copies of the background as necessary to fill
        // the screen.
        let mut physical_left = -self.pos * scale;

        while physical_left < win_w as f64 {
            renderer.copy_sprite(&self.sprite, Rectangle {
                x: physical_left,
                y: 0.0,
                w: size.0 * scale,
                h: win_h as f64,
            });

            physical_left += size.0 * scale;
        }
    }
}
```

Now, we would like to work on `GameView` without the main menu bothering us. For
this, we're going to comment out the `views::main_menu` module:

```rust
//? views/mod.rs

pub mod bullets;
pub mod game;
//pub mod main_menu;
pub mod shared;
```

And change our `main.rs` file to:

```rust
//? Importing crates...

mod phi;
mod views;

fn main() {
    ::phi::spawn("ArcadeRS Shooter", |phi| {
        let bg = ::views::shared::BgSet::new(&mut phi.renderer);
        Box::new(::views::game::GameView::with_backgrounds(phi, bg))
    });
}
```

Alright! Let us get back to `views/game.rs`.

Now that our library has been updated, we would like to update `GameView` so
that it uses the new functional approach. The only problem is that, while the
compiler is smarter than I am in a lot of ways, it's still pretty, well, dumb.
Some problems should be fixed with MIR and non-lexical borrows, but others are
fundamental limitations of Rust's type-system as of today.

Here's what we would like to do:

```rust
//? WARNING: Does not compile!

impl View for GameView {
    fn update(mut self: Box<Self>, phi: &mut Phi, elapsed: f64) -> ViewAction {
        if phi.events.now.quit {
            return ViewAction::Quit;
        }

        // TODO
        // * Implement `PauseView`
        // * Switch to `PauseView` if the user presses `Escape`


        // Update the player
        self.player.update(phi, elapsed);

        // Update the bullets
        self.bullets = self.bullets.into_iter()
            .filter_map(|bullet| bullet.update(phi, elapsed))

You should try to read this code and understand what it does. You should see
that there is no more `::std::mem::replace`; you should see that the backgrounds
are translated and drawn separately; you should see the `mut self` argument of
`update`; you should feel like it makes sense; and if you compile it... you
should see a wall of errors, one of which being

```
error: use of partially moved value: `self` [E0382]

    self.bullets = self.bullets.into_iter()
        .filter_map(|bullet| bullet.update(phi, elapsed))
        .collect();

note: `self.bullets` moved here because [...] non-copyable

    self.bullets = self.bullets.into_iter()
```

This is not a problem with `GameView` itself, but with `Box<GameView>`.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="fr"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/rustlang">@rustlang</a> being confused by Deref:<br>This works: <a href="https://t.co/7cZlmO5zqn">https://t.co/7cZlmO5zqn</a>;<br>but this doesn&#39;t: <a href="https://t.co/DfPLncsiZ1">https://t.co/DfPLncsiZ1</a>.</p>&mdash; Jessy P.-Lemire (@jadpole) <a href="https://twitter.com/jadpole/status/690969535348875264">23 janvier 2016</a></blockquote>

I would guess that this is caused by the compiler being unable to prove that the
instance returned by `DerefMut` is the same every time. Whether or not this is
the root of the problem, we'll have to find another way to do this.

As I said, Rust has no problem with `GameView` and, by extension, with
`&mut GameView`, which we've been using for a while. This has a downside and
an advantage: we must use `mem::replace` and we can keep most of our old code.

There's also another kind of error which comes up:

```
error: cannot borrow `self` (here through borrowing `self.player`) as immutable
because `self` is also borrowed as mutable (through borrowing `self.bullets`)

    self.bullets.append(&mut self.player.spawn_bullets());
                             ^~~~~~~~~~~
```

We get the same error in

```rust
self.explosions.push(
    self.explosion_factory.at_center(
        asteroid.rect().center()));
```

In other words, Rust is pretty confused about the lifetime of references (which
should stop being relevant after the function returns, but currently last until
the semicolon). This should be fixed with the advent of non-lexical borrows.
Until then, our `&mut GameView` trick should fix this. What is this trick?
Making up a new scope to hold the reference whenever we do not need to own the
data:

```rust
impl View for GameView {
    fn update(mut self: Box<Self>, phi: &mut Phi, elapsed: f64) -> ViewAction {
        if phi.events.now.quit {
            return ViewAction::Quit;
        }

        // TODO
        // * Implement `PauseView`
        // * Switch to `PauseView` if the user presses `Escape`

        {
            // We must find a new name because `self` is a reserved keyword
            // Take a reference to the content of the box (i.e. the view itself)
            let game = &mut *self;

            // Update the player
            game.player.update(phi, elapsed);

            // Update the bullets
            game.bullets =
                ::std::mem::replace(&mut game.bullets, vec![])
                .into_iter()
                .filter_map(|bullet| bullet.update(phi, elapsed))
                .collect();

            // Update the asteroids
            game.asteroids =

                    let mut asteroid_alive = true;

                    for bullet in &mut transition_bullets {

                        }
                    }

                    // The player's ship is destroyed if it is hit by an asteroid.

                    }
                })
                .collect();

            game.bullets = transition_bullets.into_iter()
                .filter_map(MaybeAlive::as_option)

```

And this actually works! If _why_ it does isn't clear to you, you should play a
bit with it until you understand it better.

Once you get the hang of it, it is pretty easy to change other pieces of code to
the new system. In fact, `MainMenuView` behaves much better than `GameView`, so
much better, in fact, that our latest _trick_ isn't even necessary.

Check this out! Change `views/main_menu.rs` to:

```rust
//? ...

impl MainMenuView {
    //? ...

    pub fn with_backgrounds(phi: &mut Phi, bg: BgSet) -> MainMenuView {
        MainMenuView {
            actions: vec![
                Action::new(phi, "New Game", Box::new(|phi, bg| {
                    ViewAction::Render(Box::new(
                        ::views::game::GameView::with_backgrounds(phi, bg)))
                })),
                Action::new(phi, "Quit", Box::new(|_, _| {
                    ViewAction::Quit
                })),
            ],
            selected: 0,
            bg: bg,
        }
    }
}

impl View for MainMenuView {
    fn update(mut self: Box<Self>, phi: &mut Phi, elapsed: f64) -> ViewAction {
        if phi.events.now.quit || phi.events.now.key_escape == Some(true) {
            return ViewAction::Quit;
        }

        // Execute the currently selected action if requested
        if phi.events.now.key_space == Some(true) ||
           phi.events.now.key_enter == Some(true) {
            let bg = self.bg.clone();
            return (self.actions[self.selected as usize].func)(phi, bg);
        }

        // Change the selected action using the keyboard
        if phi.events.now.key_up == Some(true) {
            self.selected -= 1;
            if self.selected < 0 {
                self.selected = self.actions.len() as i8 - 1;
            }
        }

        if phi.events.now.key_down == Some(true) {
            self.selected += 1;
            if self.selected >= self.actions.len() as i8 {
                self.selected = 0;
            }
        }

        // Update the backgrounds
        self.bg.back.update(elapsed);
        self.bg.middle.update(elapsed);
        self.bg.front.update(elapsed);

        ViewAction::Render(self)
    }

    fn render(&self, phi: &mut Phi) {
        // Clear the screen.
        phi.renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(0, 0, 0));
        phi.renderer.clear();

        // Render the backgrounds
        self.bg.back.render(&mut phi.renderer);
        self.bg.middle.render(&mut phi.renderer);
        self.bg.front.render(&mut phi.renderer);

        // Definitions for the menu's layout
        let (win_w, win_h) = phi.output_size();
        let label_h = 50.0;
        let border_width = 3.0;
        let box_w = 360.0;
        let box_h = self.actions.len() as f64 * label_h;
        let margin_h = 10.0;

        // Render the border of the colored box which holds the labels
        phi.renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(70, 15, 70));
        phi.renderer.fill_rect(Rectangle {
            w: box_w + border_width * 2.0,
            h: box_h + border_width * 2.0 + margin_h * 2.0,
            x: (win_w - box_w) / 2.0 - border_width,
            y: (win_h - box_h) / 2.0 - margin_h - border_width,
        }.to_sdl().unwrap());

        // Render the colored box which holds the labels
        phi.renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(140, 30, 140));
        phi.renderer.fill_rect(Rectangle {
            w: box_w,
            h: box_h + margin_h * 2.0,
            x: (win_w - box_w) / 2.0,
            y: (win_h - box_h) / 2.0 - margin_h,
        }.to_sdl().unwrap());

        // Render the labels in the menu
        for (i, action) in self.actions.iter().enumerate() {
            if self.selected as usize == i {
                let (w, h) = action.hover_sprite.size();
                phi.renderer.copy_sprite(&action.hover_sprite, Rectangle {
                    w: w,
                    h: h,
                    x: (win_w - w) / 2.0,
                    y: (win_h - box_h + label_h - h) / 2.0 + label_h * i as f64,
                });
            } else {
                let (w, h) = action.idle_sprite.size();
                phi.renderer.copy_sprite(&action.idle_sprite, Rectangle {
                    w: w,
                    h: h,
                    x: (win_w - w) / 2.0,
                    y: (win_h - box_h + label_h - h) / 2.0 + label_h * i as f64,
                });
            }
        }
    }
}
```

And it should run just fine! Of course, you should uncomment the line importing
it in `views/mod.rs` and reset `main.rs` to:

```rust
//? ...

fn main() {
    ::phi::spawn("ArcadeRS Shooter", |phi| {
        Box::new(::views::main_menu::MainMenuView::new(phi))
    });
}
```

But other than that, we're done for today!


## Conclusion

This article is already _way_ longer than I thought it would be. This means
that, in the [next one](#), we're going to do what I planned to have done today:
store the state of the game in `MainMenuView` &mdash; which has little to do
with audio anyway.

We will also continue this process of making our game and engine more flexible
by creating more enemies and letting those react to the environment. This will
allow us to explore more deeply trait objects and see how they can be combined
with tagged unions to model diverse, extensible systems.

Until then, have fun, celebrate!
