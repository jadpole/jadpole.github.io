This is the introduction of a series whose objective is to explore the Rust
programming language and ecosystem through the development of a simple,
old-school shooter. It is composed of 16 parts, excluding this introduction:

1. [A simple window](/arcaders/arcaders-1-1), where we install SDL2
2. [Event handling](/arcaders/arcaders-1-2), where we discuss lifetimes
3. [More event handling](/arcaders/arcaders-1-3), where we discuss macros
4. [Views](/arcaders/arcaders-1-4), where we learn about boxes, pattern matching, trait objects, and dynamic dispatch
5. [Switching views](/arcaders/arcaders-1-5), where we use boxes, pattern matching, trait objects, and dynamic dispatch
6. [A moving rectangle](/arcaders/arcaders-1-6), where we draw _things_
7. [Sprites](/arcaders/arcaders-1-7), where we create our player's ship
8. [Backgrounds](/arcaders/arcaders-1-8), where we handle resizing, scale and translate through time
9. [Main menu](/arcaders/arcaders-1-9), where we play with textures and Rust's vectors
10. [Asteroid attack!](/arcaders/arcaders-1-10), where we render animated asteroids
11. [Shooting bullets](/arcaders/arcaders-1-11), where we explore iterators
12. [Brawl, at last!](/arcaders/arcaders-1-12), where we make objects interact and explode
13. [« Boom! »](/arcaders/arcaders-1-13), where we play sound.
14. [Variety](#), where we create more enemies
15. [Difficulty](#), where we manage the difficulty level and the score
16. [High score & wrap-up](#), where we play with the file-system and enhance our main menu

<!--IDEA
* Tween views?
* Better error handling?

This tutorial was written for people who are already somewhat familiar with the
craft of software development, perhaps even through a scripting language, and
who have just discovered this strange beast called _Rust_. They skimmed through
the [Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book), read plenty of blog posts about
how this familiar-looking language supposedly challenges all previous ideas
about software safety and, excited, want to discover how Rust _really works out_
in practice.

![The result of the 12th episode](/images/arcade-20.png)

What I demand of the reader is that he or she (or it?) understands such concepts
as interfaces, methods, conditional structures, and (basic) static typing. Most
of the time, the meaning of these terms will be self-evident from the context.
However, if these pose a problem to you, then be informed that I will not go to
great lengths to explain them.

I also expect you to have already _learned_ a bit of Rust prior to reading this
tutorial, at least from a high level. For example, you must understand what
Rust's `use` statement does, at least in the `main.rs` file, however there is
no need to be an expert in the subject as we will discover its subtleties
together.

In the next couple of weeks, we are going to build a simple space shooter based
on Mike Geig's superb [2D Game Development Course](http://fixbyproximity.com/2d-game-development-course),
and a basic library called _phi_ which will provide us with the basic components
required by 2D games, such as _views_ (called _screens_ in LibGDX), _rectangles_
with built-in (albeit basic) collision detection, and _animated sprites_.

The libraries we are going to use for that will be AngryLawyer's SDL2 bindings,
version 0.24, which you can see [here](https://github.com/AngryLawyer/rust-sdl2),
and the associated plugins.

Before we continue, I want to stress that you do not need to have mastered Rust
prior to reading this tutorial. On the contrary, exploring Rust's subtleties is
one of its objectives, if not the main one because, let's be honest, I do not
recommend to use _phi_ in production. However, you need to have at least
skimmed through [the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/README.html) or
[Rust by Example](http://rustbyexample.com).

Basically, I will not explain the syntax, but how to _use_ it to make things.

So, without further ado, [let's get to it](/arcaders/arcaders-1-1)!


## Legal stuff

After being asked about it a few times, I thought I'd include a little disclaimer:

> You can use the code we're writing in this tutorial for whatever purpose you
> have, whether in a personal project or a commercial one.

I would like to note, however, that I do not encourage it &mdash; not because of
copyright stuff, but simply because I'm building this project with _pedagogy_ in
mind, _not_ performance or maintainability.

THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE GAME'S ASSETS, which I've mostly taken from google and
Mike Geig's course to save time. I might bother to replace those by custom
resources one day. Until then, though, you shouldn't use those in your projects,
just in case.
