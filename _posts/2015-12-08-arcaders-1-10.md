This is the tenth part of a series whose objective is to explore the Rust
programming language through the development of a simple, old-school shooter.
It is composed of 16 parts, excluding the [introduction](/arcaders/arcaders-1-0/):

1. [A simple window](/arcaders/arcaders-1-1/), where we install SDL2
2. [Event handling](/arcaders/arcaders-1-2/), where we discuss lifetimes
3. [More event handling](/arcaders/arcaders-1-3/), where we discuss macros
4. [Views](/arcaders/arcaders-1-4/), where we learn about boxes, pattern matching, trait objects, and dynamic dispatch
5. [Switching views](/arcaders/arcaders-1-5/), where we use boxes, pattern matching, trait objects, and dynamic dispatch
6. [A moving rectangle](/arcaders/arcaders-1-6/), where we draw _things_
7. [Sprites](/arcaders/arcaders-1-7/), where we create our player's ship
8. [Backgrounds](/arcaders/arcaders-1-8/), where we handle resizing, scale and translate through time
9. [Main menu](/arcaders/arcaders-1-9), where we play with textures and Rust's vectors
10. [Asteroid attack!](/arcaders/arcaders-1-10), where we render animated asteroids
11. [Shooting bullets](/arcaders/arcaders-1-11), where we explore iterators
12. [Brawl, at last!](#), where we make objects interact and explode
13. [« Boom! »](#), where we play sound.
14. [Variety](#), where we create more enemies
15. [Difficulty](#), where we manage the difficulty level and the score
16. [High score & wrap-up](#), where we play with the file-system and enhance our main menu


In the last article, we put aside the logic of our game and created a main menu
from scratch. Now, it is time to get back to business, and oh boy! Today should
be interesting, because it is time to render our first "enemy". We will start by
defining animated sprites and exploring a little more the Principle of
composition over inheritance. Then, we will render and move a single asteroid.
Finally, we will require the help of our good ol' friend `Rc` and prepare the
terrain for managing multiple asteroids at once.

While we're at it, you will need the spritesheet for the asteroids, so here it
is. You should save it as `assets/asteroid.png`.

## Animated sprites

Let us begin by opening our `phi/gfx.rs`. Under the attributes and methods of
`Sprite`, insert the following:

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct AnimatedSprite {
    /// The frames that will be rendered, in order.
    sprites: Vec<Sprite>,

    /// The time it takes to get from one frame to the next, in seconds.
    frame_delay: f64,

    /// The total time that the sprite has been alive, from which the current
    /// frame is derived.
    current_time: f64,
}

impl AnimatedSprite {
    /// Creates a new animated sprite initialized at time 0.
    pub fn new(sprites: Vec<Sprite>, frame_delay: f64) -> AnimatedSprite {
        AnimatedSprite {
            sprites: sprites,
            frame_delay: frame_delay,
            current_time: 0.0,
        }
    }

    /// Creates a new animated sprite which goes to the next frame `fps` times
    /// every second.
    pub fn with_fps(sprites: Vec<Sprite>, fps: f64) -> AnimatedSprite {
        //? Logically, a value of 0FPS might mean "stop changing frames".
        //? However, there's not really a need for this functionality in this
        //? game.
        //?
        //? If you would like to implement this functionality yourself, I would
        //? suggest that you add a `current_frame` attribute to `AnimatedSprite`
        //? which is used whenever `frame_delay`, in this scenario of type
        //? `Option<f64>`, is `None` (where `None` == infinity).
        //?
        //? Then, when `with_fps` or `set_fps` gets a value of 0, you compute
        //? the current frame and assign it to `current_frame`, then set
        //? `frame_delay` to `None`. The rest is yours to solve.
        if fps == 0.0 {
            panic!("Passed 0 to AnimatedSprite::with_fps");
        }

        AnimatedSprite::new(sprites, 1.0 / fps)
    }


    // The number of frames composing the animation.
    pub fn frames(&self) -> usize {
        self.sprites.len()
    }

    /// Set the time it takes to get from one frame to the next, in seconds.
    /// If the value is negative, then we "rewind" the animation.
    pub fn set_frame_delay(&mut self, frame_delay: f64) {
        self.frame_delay = frame_delay;
    }

    /// Set the number of frames the animation goes through every second.
    /// If the value is negative, then we "rewind" the animation.
    pub fn set_fps(&mut self, fps: f64) {
        if fps == 0.0 {
            panic!("Passed 0 to AnimatedSprite::set_fps");
        }

        self.set_frame_delay(1.0 / fps);
    }

    /// Adds a certain amount of time, in seconds, to the `current_time` of the
    /// animated sprite, so that it knows when it must go to the next frame.
    pub fn add_time(&mut self, dt: f64) {
        self.current_time += dt;

        // If we decide to go "back in time", this allows us to select the
        // last frame whenever we reach a negative one.
        if (self.current_time < 0.0) {
            self.current_time = (self.frames() - 1) as f64 * self.frame_delay;
        }
    }


    /// Renders the current frame of the sprite.
    fn render(&self, renderer: &mut Renderer, dest: Rectangle) {
        let current_frame =
            (self.current_time / self.frame_delay) as usize % self.frames();

        let sprite = &self.sprites[current_frame];
        sprite.render(renderer, dest);
    }
}
```

Simple, isn't it!


## Renderables

I would like to direct your attention to the last lines of code that we just
wrote, that is,

```rust
fn render(&self, renderer: &mut Renderer, dest: Rectangle) {
    let current_frame =
        (self.current_time / self.frame_delay) as usize % self.frames();

    let sprite = &self.sprites[current_frame];
    sprite.render(renderer, dest);
}
```

Notice how this function basically routes the `render` method to the current
frame's sprite. Otherwise, both the animated and the static sprites share the
same API. Wouldn't it be nice to use the `Renderer::render_sprite` method on
both of them?

In a language like C++, you might be tempted to make one inherit from the other
&mdash; which would lead to unnecessary complexity &mdash; or implement the same
interface for both of them. This is the approach that we will take here, namely,
we will define a new trait called `Renderable` for both to implement:

```rust
/// Common interface for rendering a graphical component to some given region
/// of the window.
pub trait Renderable {
    fn render(&self, renderer: &mut Renderer, dest: Rectangle);
}
```

Now, we must move the `render` methods of both sprites to an `impl Renderable`
block. Do not forget to remove them from the already-existing `impl` blocks.

```rust
impl Renderable for Sprite {
    fn render(&self, renderer: &mut Renderer, dest: Rectangle) {
        renderer.copy(&mut self.tex.borrow_mut(), self.src.to_sdl(), dest.to_sdl())
    }
}

//? ...

impl Renderable for AnimatedSprite {
    /// Renders the current frame of the sprite.
    fn render(&self, renderer: &mut Renderer, dest: Rectangle) {
        let current_frame =
            (self.current_time / self.frame_delay) as usize % self.frames();

        let sprite = &self.sprites[current_frame];
        sprite.render(renderer, dest);
    }
}
```

Now that this is done, what do we do with our `CopySprite` trait? Well, if you
recall our [discussion about trait objects](/arcaders/arcaders-1-4/), because
we are already passing a reference to `copy_sprite`, we could simply change its
definition so that `Sprite` is now `Renderable`:

```rust
pub trait CopySprite {
    fn copy_sprite(&mut self, sprite: &Renderable, dest: Rectangle);
}

impl<'window> CopySprite for Renderer<'window> {
    fn copy_sprite(&mut self, renderable: &Renderable, dest: Rectangle) {
       renderable.render(self, dest);
   }
}
```

This is a valid approach, but remember that trait objects have a (here mostly
negligeable) runtime cost. We could instead add a type parameter to `CopySprite`:

```rust
pub trait CopySprite<T> {
    fn copy_sprite(&mut self, sprite: &T, dest: Rectangle);
}
```

Then, we might manually implement `CopySprite<T>` on every `T` which implements
`Renderable`... but the body of the method would be the same in each case:

```rust
impl<'window> CopySprite<Sprite> for Renderer<'window> {
    fn copy_sprite(&mut self, renderable: &Sprite, dest: Rectangle) {
       renderable.render(self, dest);
   }
}

impl<'window> CopySprite<AnimatedSprite> for Renderer<'window> {
    fn copy_sprite(&mut self, renderable: &AnimatedSprite, dest: Rectangle) {
       renderable.render(self, dest);
   }
}
```

This works, don't get me wrong, but repetition is generally considered a
_Bad Thing_ in software development. Fortunately, Rust gives us a better way to
do this: _conditional implementations_.

```rust
pub trait CopySprite<T> {
    fn copy_sprite(&mut self, sprite: &T, dest: Rectangle);
}

impl<'window, T: Renderable> CopySprite<T> for Renderer<'window> {
    fn copy_sprite(&mut self, renderable: &T, dest: Rectangle) {
       renderable.render(self, dest);
   }
}
```

This says: would you kindly implement `CopySprite` on every type `T`
implementing `Renderable` for me? More specifically, when the compiler sees that
we're calling `copy_sprite` on a `Renderable` object, it will automatically
generate an `impl` block for us. Therefore, you do not have to worry about
wasting space on methods that will never be called, and you get the performance
of static dispatch without the hassle of copy-pasting implementations.

This is one area where Rust code is, by default, both faster and cleaner than
what one would write in C++ (where `virtual` methods and dynamic dispatch are
the tools typically used for solving this sort of problem).

The resulting API is close to something that you may have achieved using
_inheritance_. However, behind the scenes, it is made much cleaner from the
_composition_ of simple components together to make more complicated one. In
this case, we wrapped a `Texture` to get a `Sprite`, which we wrapped in turn
to get an `AnimatedSprite`, which we are going to use, right now, to build our
first enemy.

As a side note, if you find it annoying to write `impl<...> MyType<...>`, now
you at least know why it is mandatory.

Let's use this definition, shall we!


## A fixed asteroid

It is time to create asteroids. First, let's define a few constants about our
spritesheet:

```rust
const ASTEROID_PATH: &'static str = "assets/asteroid.png";
const ASTEROIDS_WIDE: usize = 21;
const ASTEROIDS_HIGH: usize = 7;
const ASTEROIDS_TOTAL: usize = ASTEROIDS_WIDE * ASTEROIDS_HIGH - 4;
const ASTEROID_SIDE: f64 = 96.0;
```

Next, let's create ourselves an Asteroid:

```rust
struct Asteroid {
    sprite: AnimatedSprite,
    rect: Rectangle,
    vel: f64,
}
```

We then want to generate an animated sprite with an appropriate rotational
velocity:

```rust
impl Asteroid {
    fn get_sprite(phi: &mut Phi, fps: f64) -> AnimatedSprite {
        let asteroid_spritesheet = Sprite::load(&mut phi.renderer, ASTEROID_PATH).unwrap();
        let mut asteroid_sprites = Vec::with_capacity(ASTEROIDS_TOTAL);

        for yth in 0..ASTEROIDS_HIGH {
            for xth in 0..ASTEROIDS_WIDE {
                //? There are four asteroids missing at the end of the
                //? spritesheet: we do not want to render those.
                if ASTEROIDS_WIDE * yth + xth >= ASTEROIDS_TOTAL {
                    break;
                }

                asteroid_sprites.push(
                    asteroid_spritesheet.region(Rectangle {
                        w: ASTEROID_SIDE,
                        h: ASTEROID_SIDE,
                        x: ASTEROID_SIDE * xth as f64,
                        y: ASTEROID_SIDE * yth as f64,
                    }).unwrap());
            }
        }

        AnimatedSprite::with_fps(asteroid_sprites, fps)
    }
}
```

The sprite is one component of our sprite; the others are its bounding box and
velocity. We can get its width and height from our constants, and we will stick
it at the point `(128, 128)` with velocity `0` because, that way, we can check
whether we did everything correctly before translating it.

Here's the rest of its definition (for now):

```rust
impl Asteroid {
    fn new(phi: &mut Phi) -> Asteroid {
        Asteroid {
            sprite: Asteroid::get_sprite(phi, 15.0),
            rect: Rectangle {
                w: ASTEROID_SIDE,
                h: ASTEROID_SIDE,
                x: 128.0,
                y: 128.0,
            },
            vel: 0.0,
        }
    }

    //? ...

    fn update(&mut self, _: &mut Phi, dt: f64) {
        self.sprite.add_time(dt);
    }

    fn render(&mut self, phi: &mut Phi) {
        phi.renderer.copy_sprite(&self.sprite, self.rect);
    }
}
```

Let us finally add it to our scene:

```rust
pub struct ShipView {
    player: Ship,
    asteroid: Asteroid,
    bg: BgSet,
}

impl ShipView {
    pub fn with_backgrounds(phi: &mut Phi, bg: BgSet) -> ShipView {
        //? ...

        ShipView {
            player: Ship {
                //? ...
            },

            asteroid: Asteroid::new(phi),

            bg: bg,
        }
    }
}

impl View for ShipView {
    fn render(&mut self, phi: &mut Phi, elapsed: f64) -> ViewAction {
        //? ...

        // Select the appropriate sprite of the ship to show.
        self.player.current = ...;

        // Update the asteroid
        self.asteroid.update(phi, elapsed);

        //? ...

        // Render the ship
        phi.renderer.copy_sprite(...);

        // Render the asteroid
        self.asteroid.render(phi);

        //? ...
    }
}
```

This should compile and give you something akin to this:

![A rotating asteroid](/images/arcade-15.png)


## Moving the asteroid

We would like our asteroid to move from the right to the left of the screen and,
once it gets out of view, we would like to bring it back to some random location
to the right of our camera. To do that, we will need to import a new crate,
namely `rand` version `0.3`. At this point, I'm guessing that you can do this
part yourself.

Next, let's sprinkle in some randomness and movement in our code:

```rust
impl Asteroid {
    fn new(phi: &mut Phi) -> Asteroid {
        let (w, h) = phi.output_size();

        let mut asteroid =
            Asteroid {
                sprite: Asteroid::get_sprite(phi, 1.0),
                rect: Rectangle {
                    w: 0.0,
                    h: 0.0,
                    x: 0.0,
                    y: 0.0,
                },
                vel: 0.0,
            };

        asteroid.reset(phi);
        asteroid
    }

    fn reset(&mut self, phi: &mut Phi) {
        let (w, h) = phi.output_size();

        // FPS in [10.0, 30.0)
        //? `random<f64>()` returns a value between 0 and 1.
        //? `abs()` returns an absolute value
        self.sprite.set_fps(::rand::random::<f64>().abs() * 20.0 + 10.0);

        // rect.y in the screen vertically
        self.rect = Rectangle {
            w: ASTEROID_SIDE,
            h: ASTEROID_SIDE,
            x: w,
            y: ::rand::random::<f64>().abs() * (h - ASTEROID_SIDE),
        };

        // vel in [50.0, 150.0)
        self.vel = ::rand::random::<f64>().abs() * 100.0 + 50.0;
    }

    fn get_sprite(phi: &mut Phi, fps: f64) -> AnimatedSprite {
        let asteroid_spritesheet = Sprite::load(&mut phi.renderer, ASTEROID_PATH).unwrap();
        let mut asteroid_sprites = Vec::with_capacity(ASTEROIDS_TOTAL);

        for yth in 0..ASTEROIDS_HIGH {
            for xth in 0..ASTEROIDS_WIDE {
                if ASTEROIDS_WIDE * yth + xth >= ASTEROIDS_TOTAL {
                    break;
                }

                asteroid_sprites.push(
                    asteroid_spritesheet.region(Rectangle {
                        w: ASTEROID_SIDE,
                        h: ASTEROID_SIDE,
                        x: ASTEROID_SIDE * xth as f64,
                        y: ASTEROID_SIDE * yth as f64,
                    }).unwrap());
            }
        }

        AnimatedSprite::with_fps(asteroid_sprites, fps)
    }


    fn update(&mut self, phi: &mut Phi, dt: f64) {
        self.rect.x -= dt * self.vel;
        self.sprite.add_time(dt);

        if self.rect.x <= -ASTEROID_SIDE {
            self.reset(phi);
        }
    }

    fn render(&mut self, phi: &mut Phi) {
        phi.renderer.copy_sprite(&self.sprite, self.rect);
    }
}
```

If everything went according to plan, your asteroid should now be moving from
the right to the left of the screen.

<!-- ![Moving asteroid](/images/arcade-16.gif) -->


## Reference counted frames

This is great and all, but the next logical step is to randomly generate a bunch
of asteroids. You see, although it shouldn't be much of a problem on today's
computers, and although most animated sprites will not have that many frames,
copying 143 rectangles and pointers, as we're doing here, can be mighty
expensive!

Depending on the kind of app that you are developing, you might want to share
the vector of sprites using some kind of pointer-thingy. Sounds like a task for
which `Rc` might be fit, doesn't it? And this time, there is no need to wrap the
value in a `RefCell` because our `Sprite` structure is effectively immutable and
we do not want an animated sprite to change the list of frames under everyone
else's noses.

The change is pretty simple and does not affect any other part of the code. In
fact, because an `Rc` _automatically derefs to a reference_, that is, it behaves
as though it were a reference whenever the context requires it, the change only
takes one line:

```rust
impl AnimatedSprite {
    /// Creates a new animated sprite initialized at time 0.
    pub fn new(sprites: Vec<Sprite>, frame_delay: f64) -> AnimatedSprite {
        AnimatedSprite {
            sprites: Rc::new(sprites),
            frame_delay: frame_delay,
            current_time: 0.0,
        }
    }

    //? ...
}
```

Seems good enough!


## Conclusion

This was quite a productive article! We now have a simple abstraction for
creating animated sprites (which we will reuse later when drawing explosions),
and a pattern for creating asteroids. In the [next article](/arcaders/arcaders-1-10),
we will leave our asteroid and instead allow our ship to shoot bullets. This
will be the occasion to explore iterators and learn a few tricks which we will
put in practice when managing multiple enemies and detecting collisions.

But I'm getting ahead of myself! We will go through those steps in due time.
Until then, keep rustaceanotizing!
