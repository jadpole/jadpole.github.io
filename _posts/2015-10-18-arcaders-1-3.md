In this article, we will learn about macros, more macros, and how to use the
`Option<bool>` type to represent immediate events. Before getting through this
one, though, you should read the following chapter from the Rust book:

  * [Macros](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/macros.html)

You don't need to _get_ everything, we're going to go at lengths anyway about
macros. What you do need to understand is the syntax for declaring macros, at
least at a high level.

Done? Cool! Let's push forward.

Our objective in this article will be to take our simple `Events` structure and
make a gigantic macro out of it. This macro will allow us to choose which
events we care about at compile-time and generate the `Events` type from a few
arguments, which may change from one project to the next.

This may seem a bit overkill and, for such a short-lived project, it probably
is. However, this series is more about fun, experimentation, and seeing how the
pieces fit together, and less about the game itself. In that spirit, this is a
design choice that makes sense.

And, let's be frank, it's mostly because macros are __awesome__.


## Macros in theory

Macros are a way to programmatically generate code at compile-time. They are
these things which end with a `!` when called. One declares a macro with yet
another macro called `macro_rules!`. Let's imagine a new macro called `and!`,
defined as:

```rust
macro_rules! and {
    ( $a:expr, $b:expr ) => {
        $a && $b
    }
}
```

I admit that this is quite a contrived example, but it's good enough to get an
intuition about how macros operate. Using `and!` in a program would look
something like this:

```rust
if and!(true, 3 == 4) {
    println!("Hello");
} else {
    println!("World");
}
```

When we compile this code, `rustc` goes through a step called _preprocessing_,
during which it goes over the program looking for macros and modifies the code
accordingly before it is even type-checked. When it reaches our call to `and!`,
it first goes through the patterns (called _rules_) provided in `macro_rules!`
and finds the first one to match. If none matches, the you would get an error:

```
error: no rules expected ___
```

In this case, however, we got it right. Thus, it will assign `true` to the
symbol `$a` and `3 == 4` to the symbol `$b`. Notice how it does _not_ yet
evaluate `3 == 4`; it knows that the arguments to `add!` must be an expression,
however it doesn't verify whether it is even a valid expression. This is the
job of the type checker which will run afterwards. This is one of the drawbacks
of using macros, actually, because type errors will be about the
_generated code_ and not directly about the content of the macro itself.

The preprocessor then copy-pastes the right-hand side of the macro in place of
the macro call, replacing `$`-prefixed symbols with their argument. This is
called _macro-expansion_ and, once expanded, our code looks like this:

```rust
if true && 3 == 4 {
    println!("Hello");
} else {
    println!("World");
}
```

This is what `rustc` will actually compile and the logic which will appear in
the final, executable binary (although it may have been optimized away).
With this knowledge in mind and the Rust book by your side, it is now time to
unleash the power of macros.


## Macros

You can now practically empty your `events.rs` file. We will start with the
_strict minimum_ and grow from there. What we will _add_, however, is a new,
empty struct called `ImmediateEvents`, which we will reset on every frame.
The code looks something like that:

```rust
// src/events.rs

use sdl2::EventPump;


pub struct ImmediateEvents;

impl ImmediateEvents {
    pub fn new() -> ImmediateEvents {
        ImmediateEvents
    }
}


pub struct Events {
    pump: EventPump,
    pub now: ImmediateEvents,
}

impl Events {
    pub fn new(pump: EventPump) -> Events {
        Events {
            pump: pump,
            now: ImmediateEvents::new()
        }
    }

    pub fn pump(&mut self) {
        self.now = ImmediateEvents::new();

        for event in self.pump.poll_iter() {
            use sdl2::event::Event::*;
            use sdl2::keyboard::Keycode::*;

            match event {
                _ => {}
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Let us now wrap the entire content of the file inside a single, gigantic macro
named `struct_events`:

```rust
// src/events.rs

macro_rules! struct_events {
    ( /* PATTERN */ ) => {
        use sdl2::EventPump;


        pub struct ImmediateEvents;

        impl ImmediateEvents {
            pub fn new() -> ImmediateEvents {
                ImmediateEvents
            }
        }


        pub struct Events {
            pump: EventPump,
            pub now: ImmediateEvents,
        }

        impl Events {
            pub fn new(pump: EventPump) -> Events {
                Events {
                    pump: pump,
                    now: ImmediateEvents::new()
                }
            }

            pub fn pump(&mut self) {
                self.now = ImmediateEvents::new();

                for event in self.pump.poll_iter() {
                    use sdl2::event::Event::*;
                    use sdl2::keyboard::Keycode::*;

                    match event {
                        _ => {}
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

We will figure out the pattern later. For the moment, we have to modify our
`main.rs` file to account for two things: first, we have to call the macro we
just defined in order to get an `Events` structure; second, we cannot rely on
`events.quit` and `events.key_escape` existing, at least for the next few
minutes. The resulting main file is the following:

```rust
// src/main.rs

extern crate sdl2;

// #[macro_use] asks the compiler to import the macros defined in the `events`
// module. This is necessary because macros cannot be namespaced -- macro
// expansion happens before the concept of namespace even starts to _exist_ in
// the compilation timeline.
#[macro_use]
mod events;

use sdl2::pixels::Color;


// We cannot call functions at top-level. However, `struct_events` is not your
// usual function: it's a macro. Which means that you can use a macro to do
// pretty much anything _normal_ code would.
struct_events!();


fn main() {
    // Initialize SDL2
    let sdl_context = sdl2::init().unwrap();
    let video = sdl_context.video().unwrap();

    // Create the window
    let window = video.window("ArcadeRS Shooter", 800, 600)
        .position_centered().opengl()
        .build().unwrap();

    let mut renderer = window.renderer()
        .accelerated()
        .build().unwrap();

    // Prepare the events record
    let mut events = Events::new(sdl_context.event_pump().unwrap());


    loop {
        events.pump();

        // We put `true` to make sure that the loop stops. We will put back a
        // condition based on events soon enough.
        if true {
            break;
        }

        renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(0, 0, 0));
        renderer.clear();
        renderer.present();
    }
}
```

It is to be noted that, from now on, I will explain the program mostly through
comments (lots of them), and much less through text &mdash; especially once we
start to get 200+ lines long files. This ain't your _guessing game_ tutorial
anymore! In general, you can simply delete the comments, and so will I. This
means that, between two excerpts, the logic may be pretty similar but the
comments, totally different.

Now, let's focus on the _pattern_ of our macro. We want to be able to insert a
list of keyboard events and have the Rust preprocessor generate a structure for
us, which takes care of the logic and the copy-pasting automagically. We also
would like for it to be obvious and extensible, if possible by using named
arguments (and it _is_ possible). The first version of the pattern is:

```rust
(
    keyboard: { $( $k_alias:ident : $k_sdl:ident ),* }
)
=> {
```

Basically, it means: I expect to receive an argument which is literally
`keyboard: { ... }`, where `...` is a list of zero or more comma-separated
arguments (`$( ... ),*`) whose elements are pairs of colon-separated identifiers
(`$k_alias:ident : $k_sdl:ident`).

In `main.rs`, then, we get a macro call that looks something like that:

```rust
struct_events!(
    keyboard: {
        key_escape: Escape
    }
);
```

One nice thing about macros, though, is that it is possible to replace the
parentheses by square brackets (which is the convention for `vec!`):

```rust
struct_events![
    keyboard: {
        key_escape: Escape
    }
];
```

... or by curly braces:

```rust
struct_events! {
    keyboard: {
        key_escape: Escape
    }
}
```

Notice how we drop the semicolon at the end of the last version. Moreover, it
_feels_ closer to a `struct` declaration, which is actually what is happening
behind the scenes. As such, this is the syntax that we will use from now on.

Your code should now compile successfully and running the program should give...
nothing. Or rather, it shows a window, but terminates automatically after a few
milliseconds.

Let us now _use_ the identifiers we have just added to the pattern:

```rust
macro_rules! struct_events {
    (
        keyboard: { $( $k_alias:ident : $k_sdl:ident ),* }
    )
    => {
        use sdl2::EventPump;


        pub struct ImmediateEvents {
            // For every keyboard event, we have an Option<bool>
            // Some(true)  => Was just pressed
            // Some(false) => Was just released
            // None        => Nothing happening _now_
            $( pub $k_alias: Option<bool> ),*
        }

        impl ImmediateEvents {
            pub fn new() -> ImmediateEvents {
                ImmediateEvents {
                    // When reinitialized, nothing has yet happened, so all are
                    // set to None
                    $( $k_alias: None ),*
                }
            }
        }


        pub struct Events {
            pump: EventPump,
            pub now: ImmediateEvents,

            // true  => pressed
            // false => not pressed
            $( pub $k_alias: bool ),*
        }

        impl Events {
            pub fn new(pump: EventPump) -> Events {
                Events {
                    pump: pump,
                    now: ImmediateEvents::new(),

                    // By default, initialize every key with _not pressed_
                    $( $k_alias: false ),*
                }
            }

            pub fn pump(&mut self) {
                self.now = ImmediateEvents::new();

                for event in self.pump.poll_iter() {
                    use sdl2::event::Event::*;
                    use sdl2::keyboard::Keycode::*;

                    match event {
                        KeyDown { keycode, .. } => match keycode {
                            // $( ... ),* containing $k_sdl and $k_alias means:
                            //   "for every element ($k_alias : $k_sdl) pair,
                            //    check whether the keycode is Some($k_sdl). If
                            //    it is, then set the $k_alias fields to true."
                            $(
                                Some($k_sdl) => {
                                    // Prevent multiple presses when keeping a key down
                                    // Was previously not pressed?
                                    if !self.$k_alias {
                                        // Key pressed
                                        self.now.$k_alias = Some(true);
                                    }

                                    self.$k_alias = true;
                                }
                            ),* // and add a comma after every option
                            _ => {}
                        },

                        KeyUp { keycode, .. } => match keycode {
                            $(
                                Some($k_sdl) => {
                                    // Key released
                                    self.now.$k_alias = Some(false);
                                    self.$k_alias = false;
                                }
                            ),*
                            _ => {}
                        },

                        _ => {}
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

There we go! And now, one could add as many keyboard listeners as he'd like,
as long as they are defined in `rust-sdl2`. For example, if you'd like to
listen to the up and down arrows (for example, for moving in a menu), you
could simply change the macro invocation to:

```rust
struct_events! {
    keyboard: {
        key_escape: Escape,
        key_up: Up,
        key_down: Down
    }
}
```

I must point out, however, that unlike the `struct`, `match`, ... built-ins
provided by Rust, our macro does _not_ allow trailing commas.

Let's now say that we would like to know whether escape _was just pressed_.
In which case, we would like to close our window (break out of the main loop).
Then, we could change, in `main.rs`...

```rust
if true {
    break;
}
```

... to...

```rust
if events.now.key_escape == Some(true) {
    break;
}
```

So, we're pretty much done with handling the keyboard. Hurray! Still, we can't
listen to `Quit` events, nor to other devices, such as the mouse. We will not
go too deep into the rabbit hole for such a simple project. However, I would
at least like to be able to do the first task. Now that the heavy-lifting is
done and the foundations, solid, it seems to be a good time to do so.


## Moar inputs!!

Let us now handle the case where, like with `Quit`, we only care about whether
or not the event _happened_ or _matches a pattern exactly_. As such, we will
store this state in a boolean value. Unlike key presses, though, we cannot get
`NOT(pattern)`. This means that we can neither turn back the value to `false`,
nor assign a `Some(false)` value to `self.now.whatever`.

With this in mind, it does not make much sense to add a value directly to our
`events` object, nor does it make sense to have an _immediate_ attribute of
type `Option<bool>`. What _would_ make sense would be to store the state only
in an _immediate_ attribute of type `bool`.

Also, because it can be used as a _catch-all_ for events that our system
doesn't know about, we will handle it at the end of our macro.

So, let's do it, shall we! We first change the pattern to:

```rust
(
    keyboard: { $( $k_alias:ident : $k_sdl:ident ),* },

    // Match against a pattern
    else: { $( $e_alias:ident : $e_sdl:pat ),* }
)
```

In the `main.rs` file, we can now ask to listen to the `Quit` event:

```rust
struct_events! {
    keyboard: {
        key_escape: Escape,
        key_up: Up,
        key_down: Down
    },
    else: {
        quit: Quit { .. }
    }
}
```

All that is needed from us now is to handle it generically inside the macro. I
challenge you to try to do it yourself. Go ahead! It feels fair to give you a
few hints, so here they are:

  * Expanding with `$( ... ),*` inside `struct` fields does not actually add a comma at the end, so you should use `$( ... , )*` instead.
  * A `pat` argument can be placed anywhere a pattern would in normal code.

Try it out: fail, succeed, and see what you come up with.

...

I'm assuming that you had a go at it. So, without further due, here's my
solution. First, change the `ImmediateEvents` attributes and constructor as
such:

```rust
pub struct ImmediateEvents {
    $( pub $k_alias : Option<bool> , )*
    $( pub $e_alias : bool ),*
}

impl ImmediateEvents {
    pub fn new() -> ImmediateEvents {
        ImmediateEvents {
            $( $k_alias: None , )*
            $( $e_alias: false ),*
        }
    }
}
```

Then, right before the `_ => {}` in the main `match` statement, insert:

```rust
$(
    $e_sdl => {
        self.now.$e_alias = true;
    }
)*,
```

If all works out as expected, it should compile and you should now be able to
use the good ol' conditional structure that we previously added in `main`,
that is:

```rust
if events.now.quit || events.now.key_escape == Some(true) {
    break;
}
```


## Conclusion

If everything went according to plan, you now know more than you did previously
about macros and the way that we can use them to do ADD, or
_awesomeness-driven-development_. In fact, this is just the tip of the iceberg.
It turns out that you can implement entire design patterns in such a way that
they feel almost _native_ to the language.

I will soon write an [article](/rust/builder-macro/) about implementing the
_builder pattern_, that we saw previously, using a macro. The result is stunning:

```rust
builder!(UserBuilder => User {
    name : String = None,
    age  : u32    = Some(0)
});

impl User {
    // ...
}

let user = UserBuilder::new()
    .name("Bobby")
    .build().unwrap();

//> Bobby, 0
println!("{}, {}", user.name, user.age);
```

All you need is to import a crate, `#[macro_use]` the module and enjoy!
This is one of the reason why I love Rust so much: it allows the community to
grow the language, and the `!` (pronounced "_bang_") allows to differentiate
between library and compiler business. This is great!

[Next time](/arcaders/arcaders-1-4), we will take a look at
_traits_, another one of Rust's dominating features. Soon enough, we will
program an extensible menu system using yet another macro and trait objects. By
the time we get to the actual game logic and rendering, we will have a solid
foundation and you should be able to do most of the work yourself, gaze at your
creation, and perhaps create a couple other small games on your own.

But I'm getting ahead of myself! The next tutorials should come in a close
future. Until then, keep rusting!
